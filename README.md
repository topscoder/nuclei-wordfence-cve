## 🚀 Quick Start

To install this `nuclei-wordfence-cve` repository for use with Nuclei, you can use the following commands:

```bash
export GITHUB_TEMPLATE_REPO=topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve
nuclei -update-templates
```

Once you have installed this template repo using the commands above, you can run the following command to scan for vulnerabilities using Nuclei:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -u https://target.com
```

Wordfence provides two separate feeds for vulnerabilities. The first feed includes only production vulnerabilities, each with an assigned CVE. The second feed contains candidate vulnerabilities, which do not yet have a CVE assigned and may or may not be promoted to the production feed. To differentiate templates generated from these feeds, a tag is assigned to each template—either production or candidate—allowing you to target them using a tag filter. Read more about the feeds at https://www.wordfence.com/help/wordfence-intelligence/v2-accessing-and-consuming-the-vulnerability-data-feed/

_Include only production templates:_
```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags production -u https://target.com
```

_Include only candidate templates:_
```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags candidate -u https://target.com
```

### 💻 Examples

Here are some examples how to use the templates:

* To scan for **all known vulnerabilities** in WordPress, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -u https://target.com
```

* To scan for a **CVE specific vulnerability**, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -template-id cve-2023-32961 -u https://target.com
```

* To scan only for **critical vulnerabilities**, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -severity critical -u https://target.com
```

* To scan only for **WordPress core vulnerabilities**, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags wp-core -u https://target.com
```

* To scan only for **WordPress plugin vulnerabilities**, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags wp-plugin -u https://target.com
```

* To scan only for **WordPress theme vulnerabilities**, you can run the following command:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags wp-theme -u https://target.com
```

* To go wild, you can combine and combine and combine:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -tags wp-plugin,wp-theme -severity critical,high
```

* To go even wilder, you can use the template condition flag (`-tc`) that allows complex expressions like the following ones:

```bash
nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -template-condition "contains(to_lower(name),'cross-site scripting') || contains(to_upper(name),'XSS')" -u https://target.com

nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -template-condition "contains(to_lower(name),'sql injection') || contains(to_lower(description),'sql injection')" -u https://target.com

nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -template-condition "contains(to_lower(name),'file inclusion') || contains(to_lower(description),'file inclusion')" -u https://target.com

nuclei -t github/topscoder/nuclei-wordfence-cve -template-condition "contains(to_upper(name),'CSRF') || contains(to_upper(description),'CSRF')" -u https://target.com
```
