    YourChannel <= 1.2.1 - Missing Authorization Checks leading to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on 'save', 'delete', 'deleteLang', and 'saveLang' functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save or delete plugin data that can potentially lead to injected arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
