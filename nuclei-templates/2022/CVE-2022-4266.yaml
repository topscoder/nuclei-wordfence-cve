    Bulk Delete Users by Email <= 1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Bulk Delete Users by Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the baw_settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete users, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
