  name: >
    BackupWordPress <= 3.12 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The BackupWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 3.12. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.
