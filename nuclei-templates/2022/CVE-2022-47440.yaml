info:
  name: >
    My Tickets <= 1.9.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The My Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions including mt_reports_page and mt_import_settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send mass-emails to users and import new plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
