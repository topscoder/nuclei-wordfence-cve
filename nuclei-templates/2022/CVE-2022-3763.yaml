    Booster for WooCommerce (Free <= 5.6.6, Premium <= 5.6.4) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.6.6 (Free) and 5.6.4 (Premium). This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when deleting files uploaded during checkout. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete those files, via forged request granted they can trick a site Shop Manager into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
