    Chronoforms <= 7.0.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Chronoforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a wide variety of actions such as creating a new form via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
