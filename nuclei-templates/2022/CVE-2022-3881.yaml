info:
  name: >
    WP Tools <= 3.42 - Missing Authorization to Select Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wptools_install_plugin() function in versions up to, and including, 3.42. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permission, such as a subscriber, to install other plugins owned by the developer on the vulnerable site. This could be used to install additional vulnerable plugins that could aid in further compromise of the site.
