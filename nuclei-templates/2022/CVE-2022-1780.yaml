    LaTeX <= 3.4.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update and Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The LaTeX for WordPress plugin through 3.4.10 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack which could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
