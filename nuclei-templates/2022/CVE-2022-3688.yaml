  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WPQA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 5.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on some of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these functions leading users to follow or unfollow others, via forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
