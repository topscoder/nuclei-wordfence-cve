id: CVE-2022-1946

info:
  name: "Gallery – Image and Video Gallery with Thumbnails <= 1.9.9 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Gallery – Image and Video Gallery with Thumbnails plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.9.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the gallery_current_index parameter supplied via the wp_ajax_wpda_gall_load_image_info AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
