  name: >
    Duplicator – WordPress Migration Plugin <= 1.4.7 - Unauthenticated Backup Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Duplicator WordPress Plugin is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Backup Download in versions up to, and including, 1.4.7 via the 'is_daws' parameter due to the fact that the source code of the response contains the randomized filename related to the back-up file that also exists in the same directory. This makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to download a full site backup which may contain sensitive information. This requires that the installer script has been run at least once by a site owner/administrator.
