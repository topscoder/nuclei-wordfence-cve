    Download Manager <= 3.2.49 - IP Blocking Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Blocking Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.2.49 due to the way the visitor's IP address is determined. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to spoof their IP address to obtain access to files that are protected by this functionality.
