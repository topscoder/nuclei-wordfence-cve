  name: >
    Yith WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium <= 3.19.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Yith WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability checks in the import_actions_from_settings_panel function in versions up to, and including, 3.19.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This is being actively exploited.
