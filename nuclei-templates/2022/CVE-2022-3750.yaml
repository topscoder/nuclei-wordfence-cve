    Ask Me < 6.8.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Ask Me theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 6.8.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke that function, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
