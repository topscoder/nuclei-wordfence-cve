info:
  name: >
    Team Members <= 5.2.0 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Team Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via some of its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 5.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
