info:
  name: >
    Restaurant Menu – Food Ordering System – Table Reservation <= 2.3.0 - Missing Authorization on AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Restaurant Menu – Food Ordering System – Table Reservation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass via several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including 2.3.0 due to missing capability checks and missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying the plugin's settings and modifying the ordering system preferences.
