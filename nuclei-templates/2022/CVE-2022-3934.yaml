  name: >
    Flat PM <= 2.661 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Flat PM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.661 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the block_cat_ID value. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
