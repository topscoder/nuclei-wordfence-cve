  name: >
    Transposh WordPress Translation <= 1.0.8.1 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions and above to perform many administrative actions such as initiating new back-ups, modifying the plugin's settings, deleting duplicates, and more.
