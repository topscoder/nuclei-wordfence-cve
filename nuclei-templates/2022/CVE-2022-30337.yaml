  name: >
    WP Meta SEO <= 4.4.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.8. This is due to incorrect nonce validation which only verifies the presence of a nonce value rather than the on the validity of the nonce on a couple of cases in the loadPage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
