    WP Job Portal <= 2.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Job Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajaxhandler function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings (e.g., delete the company logo) via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
