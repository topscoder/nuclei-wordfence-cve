info:
  name: >
    Taskbuilder <= 1.0.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Taskbuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file upload in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts into SVG files that are uploaded as part of the task creation process and that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page or access such an SVG file directly.
