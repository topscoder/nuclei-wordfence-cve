id: CVE-2022-4346

info:
  name: >
    All-In-One Security <= 5.1.2 - Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All-In-One Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure in versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to the plugin allowing administrators to upload backups to publicly accessible folders for restoring purposes. While under normal use these files would be deleted as part of the restore process, it is possible they are left behind when the restore is abandoned. This could allow unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive user or configuration data under rare circumstances in certain server configurations.
