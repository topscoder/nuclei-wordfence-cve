    The Post Grid – Shortcode, Gutenberg Blocks and Elementor Addon for Post Grid <= 5.0.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in rttpg_spare_me
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The The Post Grid – Shortcode, Gutenberg Blocks and Elementor Addon for Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rttpg_spare_me function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss plugin notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
