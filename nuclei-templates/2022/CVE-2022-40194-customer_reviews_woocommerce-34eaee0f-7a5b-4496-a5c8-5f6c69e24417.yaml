    Customer Reviews for WooCommerce <= 5.3.5 - Sensitive Data Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin contains several AJAX actions that are not protected by capability or nonce checks in versions up to, and including, 5.3.5. This allows authenticated users, such as subscribers, to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators, such as exporting sensitive data including unpublished reviews.
