    Fusion Builder <= 3.6.1 & Avada <= 7.6.1  - Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Fusion Builder plugin for WordPress, an Avada theme core plugin, is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in versions up to 3.6.2 along with the Avada theme in versions up to 7.6.2. This is due to insufficient validation in one of its form parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to interact with internal network hosts via specially crafted requests and can lead to sensitive information disclosure on certain configurations such as AWS.
