  name: >
    Web Invoice <= 2.1.3 - Authenticated SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Web Invoice plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.1.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. By default this applies to administrators but depending on the plugin configuration can also allow other authenticated users such as subscribers to exploit this.
