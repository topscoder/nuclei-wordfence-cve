info:
  name: >
    Workreap <= 2.6.3 - Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Workreap theme for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 2.6.3. This is due to missing validation on if an addon service belongs to an individual making a request to the workreap_addons_service_remove action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to call arbitrary addon services and delete posts.
