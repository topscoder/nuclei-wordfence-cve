info:
  name: >
    Contact Form Entries <= 1.2.9 - CSV Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Contact Form Entries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9 when outputting to a CSV file. This allows low-level attackers to embed untrusted input contact forms that will be present in exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
