id: CVE-2022-45841

info:
  name: >
    Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery <= 3.2.9 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Robo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 3.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to create articles, list posts, activate and deactivate addons and reset gallery view counts. Furthermore, several of these AJAX actions were missing Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection.
