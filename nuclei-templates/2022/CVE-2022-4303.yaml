    WP Limit Login Attempts <= 2.6.4 - IP Spoofing to Protection Mechanism Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Limit Login Attempts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.6.4. This is due to the plugin prioritizing obtaining a visitor's IP address from a spoofable HTTP header over PHP's REMOTE_ADDR. Attackers can supply a header with with a different IP Address that can be used to bypass settings that may have blocked out an IP address.
