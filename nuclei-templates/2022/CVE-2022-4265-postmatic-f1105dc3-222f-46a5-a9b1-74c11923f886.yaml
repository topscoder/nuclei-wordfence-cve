    Replyable – Subscribe to Comments and Reply by Email <= 2.2.9 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) PHP Object Injection via prompt_dismiss_notice
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Replyable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.9 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'class' parameter used by the prompt_dismiss_notice AJAX action. This allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
