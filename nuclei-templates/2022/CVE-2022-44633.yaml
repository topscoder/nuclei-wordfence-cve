  name: >
    YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium <= 3.23.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized gift card creation due to a missing capability check on one of its functions in versions up to, and including, 3.23.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create gift cards. Sanitization of user input is also insufficient, which allows users to inject malicious scripts.
