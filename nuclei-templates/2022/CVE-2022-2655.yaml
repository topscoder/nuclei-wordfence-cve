  name: >
    Classified Listing Pro < 2.0.20 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Classified Listing Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via URL in versions up to 2.0.20 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the URL being requested and reflected on the page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
