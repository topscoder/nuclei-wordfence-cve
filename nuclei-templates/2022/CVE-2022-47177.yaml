info:
  name: >
    WP EasyPay <= 4.0.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP EasyPay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on  several of the plugin's functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function and modify plugin settings via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
