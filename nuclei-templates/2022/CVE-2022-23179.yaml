  name: >
    Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin < 1.7.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to 1.7.0 (exclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
