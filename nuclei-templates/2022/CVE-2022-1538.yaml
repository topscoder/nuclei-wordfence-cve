info:
  name: >
    Theme Demo Import <= 1.1.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Theme Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the ~/upload.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This issue is not patched in version 1.1.1 due to the fact that the extension checking was only applied client-side.
