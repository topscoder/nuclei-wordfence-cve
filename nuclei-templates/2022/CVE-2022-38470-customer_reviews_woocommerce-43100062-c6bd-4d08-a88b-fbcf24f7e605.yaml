  name: >
    Customer Reviews for WooCommerce <= 5.3.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin contains several AJAX actions that are not protected by capability or nonce checks in versions up to, and including, 5.3.5. This allows unauthenticated attackers to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators, such as exporting reviews and sending test emails, if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action, such as clicking a link.
