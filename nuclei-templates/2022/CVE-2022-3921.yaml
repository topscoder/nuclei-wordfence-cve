    Listingo <= 3.2.5 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Listingo theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via one of its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
