  name: >
    Showing URL in QR Code <= 0.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Showing URL in QR Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the urlinqrcoed_menu_callback_func() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or editor into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
