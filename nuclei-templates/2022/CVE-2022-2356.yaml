info:
  name: >
    Frontend File Manager & Sharing – User Private Files <= 1.1.2 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Frontend File Manager & Sharing – User Private Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_doc_callback function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible under certain conditions. The plugin adds a Rewrite Rule to the site's .htaccess file in order to ensure that direct file access is not possible. However, deactivation of the plugin or resetting of the .htaccess file would lead to potential for Remote Code Execution. Servers other than Apache may ignore .htaccess files and be vulnerable to RCE.
