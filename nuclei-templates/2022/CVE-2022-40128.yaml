    Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce <= 3.3.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the export download functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute this code on behalf of an administrator, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
