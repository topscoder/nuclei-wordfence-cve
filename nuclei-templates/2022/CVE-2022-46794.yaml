  name: >
    WooCommerce Weight Based Shipping <= 5.4.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Plugin Settings Changes
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Weight Based Shipping plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.4.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and delete weight based shipping rules via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
