  name: >
    Flipbox – Awesomes Flip Boxes Image Overlay <= 2.6.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Flipbox – Awesomes Flip Boxes Image Overlay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary options updates in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to a lack of validation on the settings supplied to the oxi_settings() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative level permissions, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This would only affect sites where the administrator has been restricted to not 'manage_options' or the administrator has allowed users with lower permissions to update the plugin's settings.
