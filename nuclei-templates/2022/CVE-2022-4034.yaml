info:
  name: >
    Appointment Hour Booking <= 1.3.72 - CSV Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Appointment Hour Booking Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.3.72. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into content during booking creation that may be exported as a CSV file when a site's administrator exports booking details. This can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
