    BeRocket Plugins <= (Various Versions) - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Several BeRocket Plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on functions corresponding to AJAX actions that are available to subscribers. This includes the close_notice, subscribe, disable_rate_notice, feature_request_send, get_plugin_error_ajax, close_notice, and test_key functions This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions intended for administrator use. One of the functions is used to subscribe to the BeRocket newsletter and can be used by subscribers to subscribe arbitrary email addresses. These functions are still missing Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection.
