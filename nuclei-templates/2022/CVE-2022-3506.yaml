  name: >
    Related Posts for WordPress <= 2.1.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Related Posts for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘heading_text’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note, this vulnerability was independently found by two researchers.
