    Advanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce <= 4.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Advanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handleSubmitAction function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
