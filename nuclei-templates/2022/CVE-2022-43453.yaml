  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 3.41. This is due to missing capability check resulting in authorization bypass. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access unspecified user controls granted at a higher authorization-level.
