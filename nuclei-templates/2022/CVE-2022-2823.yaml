  name: >
    Slider, Gallery, and Carousel by MetaSlider – Responsive WordPress Plugin <= 3.27.8 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The "Slider, Gallery, and Carousel by MetaSlider – Responsive WordPress Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.27.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of some of its parameters. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
