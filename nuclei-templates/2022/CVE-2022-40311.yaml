  name: >
    Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Made Easy <= 1.0.9 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's settings parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the fca_ga_input() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative-level permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
