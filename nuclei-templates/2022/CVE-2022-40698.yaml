info:
  name: >
    Quiz And Survey Master <= 7.3.10 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 7.3.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. If the plugin setting "Require User Login" is disabled, this vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
