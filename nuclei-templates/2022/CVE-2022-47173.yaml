info:
  name: "Connect Contact Form 7, WooCommerce To Google Sheets & Other Platforms – Advanced Form Integration <= 1.62.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Cross Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Connect Contact Form 7, WooCommerce To Google Sheets & Other Platforms – Advanced Form Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.62.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
