    Booster (<= 5.6.6), Booster Plus (<= 5.6.5), and Booster Elite (<= 1.1.7) for WooCommerce - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Arbitrary Custom Role Creation/Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Booster plugins (Booster, Booster Plus, and Booster Elite) for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.6.6 (Booster), 5.6.5 (Plus), and 1.1.7 (Elite). This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on functions such as 'process_actions' and 'get_delete_all_custom_statuses_button'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and delete arbitrary custom roles via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
