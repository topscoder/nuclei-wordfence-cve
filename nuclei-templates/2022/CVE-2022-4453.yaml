  name: >
    3D FlipBook <= 1.13.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The 3D FlipBook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 1.13.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
