    Event Monster – Event Management, Tickets Booking, Upcoming Event <= 1.1.20 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Event Monster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when processing AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these actions and perform actions like deleting all visitor records, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
