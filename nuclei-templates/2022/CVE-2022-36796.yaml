  name: >
    CallRail Phone Call Tracking <= 0.4.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The CallRail Phone Call Tracking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.4.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the callrail_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected post or page, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
