  name: >
    ULeak Security & Monitoring Plugin <= 1.2.3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ULeak Security & Monitoring WordPress plugin through 1.2.3 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating its settings, and is also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of them, which could allow any authenticated users such as subscriber to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against admins viewing the settings.
