info:
  name: >
    Memory Usage <= 2.45 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Memory Usage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wpmemory_install_plugin() function in versions up to, and including, 2.45. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permission, such as a subscriber, to install arbitrary plugins on the vulnerable site. This could be used to install additional vulnerable plugins that could aid in further compromise of the site.
