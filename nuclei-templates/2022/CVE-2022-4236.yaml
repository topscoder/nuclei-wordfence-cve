  name: >
    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.8.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to missing restrictions to proper file paths in one of its AJAX actions in versions 2.6.10-2.8.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and higher, to read arbitrary files on the affected sites server leading to information disclosure.
