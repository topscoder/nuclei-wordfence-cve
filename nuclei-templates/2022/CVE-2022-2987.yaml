info:
  name: >
    Ldap WP Login / Active Directory Integration  <= 3.0.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Ldap WP Login / Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass and Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 3.0.1, due to missing nonce and capability checks on several of it's functions called via init hooks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's setting and potentially connect their own LDAP server to make authentication bypass possible.
