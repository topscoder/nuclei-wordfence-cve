info:
  name: >
    Ezoic <= 2.8.8 - Missing Authorization to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Ezoic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass to stored cross-site scripting via several REST-API endpoints in versions up to, and including, 2.8.8 due to missing capability checks and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated-level attackers to make settings changes in the plugin.  Because of protections lacking in the plugin settings, it will allow attackers to subsequently inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
