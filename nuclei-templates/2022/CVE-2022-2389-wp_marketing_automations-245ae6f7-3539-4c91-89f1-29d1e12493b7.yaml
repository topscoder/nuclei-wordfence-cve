  description: >
    The Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce by Autonami plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized execution of various AJAX actions due to insufficient capability checking and nonce validation on various AJAX actions and their hooked functions in versions up to, and including 2.1.1.
