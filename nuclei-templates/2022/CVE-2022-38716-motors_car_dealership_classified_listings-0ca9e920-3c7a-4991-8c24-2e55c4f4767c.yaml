    Motors – Car Dealer & Classified Ads <= 1.4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via Multiple Functions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Motors – Car Dealer & Classified Ads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
