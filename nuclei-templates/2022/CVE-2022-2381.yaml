  name: >
    E Unlocked - Student Result <= 1.0.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The E Unlocked - Student Result plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/menu-files/settings/settings.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and upload arbitrary files due to missing file type validation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
