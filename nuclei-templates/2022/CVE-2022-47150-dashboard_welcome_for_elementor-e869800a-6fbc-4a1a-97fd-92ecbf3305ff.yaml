info:
  name: >
    Appsero <= 1.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Appsero analytics tool used in several plugins is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the uninstall_reason_submission function used for feedback submission in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function intended for administrator use via forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
