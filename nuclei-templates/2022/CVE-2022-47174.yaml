  name: >
    Performance Lab <= 2.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via dismiss-wp-pointer
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Performance Lab plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss-wp-pointer AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss new feature pointers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
