  name: >
    YDS Support Ticket System <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The YDS Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create user tickets, and perform other actions, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    
    It should be noted that several actions are also available to unauthenticated users via nopriv ajax actions.
