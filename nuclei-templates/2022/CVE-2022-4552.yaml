  name: >
    FL3R FeelBox <= 8.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The FL3R FeelBox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'feelbox_settings_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to updates plugin settings and inject arbitrary web scripts into web pages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
