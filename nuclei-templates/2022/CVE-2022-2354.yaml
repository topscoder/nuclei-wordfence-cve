  name: >
    WP-DBManager <= 2.80.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Remote Code Execution on Multi-Site
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP-DBManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution due to an incorrect capability check in the ~/database-backup.php file in versions up to, and including, 2.80.7. This makes it possible for high level authenticated users, such as administrators, to run arbitrary commands on the affected server. This only affects multi-site installations where an administrator wouldn't have the capability to run arbitrary code.
