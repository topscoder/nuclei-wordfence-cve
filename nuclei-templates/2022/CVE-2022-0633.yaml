    UpdraftPlus WordPress Backup Plugin < 1.22.3 - Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.
    
    The UpdraftPlus WordPress Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check when performing a heartbeat function in versions up to 1.22.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions such as a subscriber to retrieve the path to arbitrary back-up files which can subsequently be downloaded and used to gain sensitive information about the system. This also affects premium versions before before 2.22.3.
