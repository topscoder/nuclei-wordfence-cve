  name: >
    ThirstyAffiliates Affiliate Link Manager <= 3.10.4 - Authorization Bypass and Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ThirstyAffiliates Affiliate Link Manager WordPress plugin before 3.10.5 lacks authorization checks in the ta_insert_external_image action, allowing a low-privilege user (with a role as low as Subscriber) to add an image from an external URL to an affiliate link. Further the plugin lacks CSRF checks, allowing an attacker to trick a logged in user to perform the action by crafting a special request.
