  name: >
    WP Maintenance <= 6.0.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 6.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
