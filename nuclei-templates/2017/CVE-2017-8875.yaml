info:
  name: >
    Clean Login <= 1.10.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Clean Login for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.10.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clean_login_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Note this vulnerability was not patched in version 1.8 as stated in the CVE record.
