info:
  name: >
    TimThumb <= 1.33 - Remote File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    TimThumb (timthumb.php) before 2.0 does not validate the entire source with the domain white list, which allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code via a URL containing a white-listed domain in the src parameter, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in the cache directory, as exploited in the wild in August 2011. Note: this is not a WordPress plugin or theme, but may be used by WordPress plugins and themes. Make sure to check for the presence of  the timthumb.php file when determining if your installation is vulnerable.
