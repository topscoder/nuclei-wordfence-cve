  name: >
    Kish Guest Posting <= 1.1 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Kish Guest Posting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.2.
