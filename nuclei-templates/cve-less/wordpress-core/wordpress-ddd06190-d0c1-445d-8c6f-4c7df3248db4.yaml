    WordPress Core < 6.0.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wp-trackback.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    WordPress Core is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery via wp-trackback.php in versions up to 6.0.3. This is due to the fact that the any request to wp-trackback.php would assume the identity of the user whose cookies are sent with the request. This would make it possible for an unauthenticated user to trigger a trackback assuming the identity of another user, granted they could trick that other user into performing the action. In new versions of WordPress, the identity will always be a non-existent user with the ID of 0, which represents an unauthenticated user.
