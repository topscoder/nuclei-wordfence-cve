    Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme <= 2.2 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.2 (11 March 2020) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The vulnerabilities were patched in version 2.2 (1 September 20).
