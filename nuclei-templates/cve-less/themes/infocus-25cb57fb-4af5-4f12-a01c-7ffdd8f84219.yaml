    InFocus <= 3.3 - Arbitrary File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The inFocus Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to the '_mysite_download_skin' parameter in the 'dl-skin.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any file within the server of the vulnerable service.
