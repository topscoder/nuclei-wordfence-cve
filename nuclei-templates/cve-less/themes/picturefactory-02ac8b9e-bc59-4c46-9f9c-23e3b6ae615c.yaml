    Picture Factory (Unspecified Versions) - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Picture Factory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
