    Zoner - Real Estate <= 4.1 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Zoner - Real Estate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated and unauthenticated attackers (NOTE: depending on which type of XSS the attacker is performing) to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
