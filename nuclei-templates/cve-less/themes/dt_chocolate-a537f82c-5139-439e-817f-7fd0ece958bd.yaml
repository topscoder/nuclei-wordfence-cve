    Chocolate WP – Responsive Photography Theme (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Chocolate WP – Responsive Photography Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of TimThumb in all versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
