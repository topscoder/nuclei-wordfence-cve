    Ya'aburnee <= 1.0.7 and Dignitas <= 1.1.9 - Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Ya'aburnee and Dignitas themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 and 1.1.9 via the 'df_save_options' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to escalate their privileges on the vulnerable service and gain otherwise restricted access to Admin actions.
