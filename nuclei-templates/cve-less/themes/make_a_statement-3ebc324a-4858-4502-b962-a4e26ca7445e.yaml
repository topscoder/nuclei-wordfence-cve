    Make A Statement (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Make A Statement theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload-handler.php' file in all known versions. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
