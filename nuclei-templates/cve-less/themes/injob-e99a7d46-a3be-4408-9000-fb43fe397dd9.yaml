    InJob | Multi features for recruitment WordPress Theme < 3.3.8 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The InJob | Multi features for recruitment WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
