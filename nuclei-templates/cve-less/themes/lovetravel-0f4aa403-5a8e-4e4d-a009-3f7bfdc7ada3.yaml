    Love Travel 1.0 - 1.9 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Frame Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Love Travel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Frame Scripting via the 'nd_travel_archive_form_keyword' and 'nd_travel_typology_slug' parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0 - 1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
