    Dimension (Unknown Versions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Dimension theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-handler.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
