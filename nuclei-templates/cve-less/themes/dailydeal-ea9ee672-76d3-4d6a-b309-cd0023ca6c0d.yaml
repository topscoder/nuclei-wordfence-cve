    Daily Deal (Unknown Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Daily Deal theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the /monetize/upload/ directory in unknown versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
