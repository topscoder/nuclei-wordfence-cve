    Dailydeal by Templatic < = 3.0.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Dailydeal by Templatic theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via CSRF due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-file.php' file in versions up to, and including, 3.0.10. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
