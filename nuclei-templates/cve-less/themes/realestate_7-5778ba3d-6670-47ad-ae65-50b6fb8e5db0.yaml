    Real Estate 7 Theme <= 3.3.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Email Sending
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Real Estate 7 Theme for WordPress suffers from an Open Mailer vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This is due to a lack of authorization in the /includes/ajax-submit-favorites.php and /includes/ajax-submit-listings.php files which are reachable via AJAX call but also directly via POST. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with any content to any recipient.
