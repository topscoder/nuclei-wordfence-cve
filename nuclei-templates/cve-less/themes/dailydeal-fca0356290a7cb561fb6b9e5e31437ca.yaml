info:
  name: "Daily Deal (Unknown Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Daily Deal theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the /monetize/upload/ directory in unknown versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
