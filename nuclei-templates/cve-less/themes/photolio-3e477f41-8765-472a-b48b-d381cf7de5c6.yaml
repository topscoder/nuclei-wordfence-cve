    Photolio Theme (All Known Versions) - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Photolio Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer in all known versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
