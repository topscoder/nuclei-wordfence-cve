    Chocolate WP – Responsive Photography Theme (All Versions) - Denial of Service and Abuse of Functionality
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Chocolate WP – Responsive Photography Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Denial of Service and Abuse of Functionality in all versions. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of TimThumb. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send users to other websites if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking a link in addition to causing a loss of functionality on the site.
