  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Method Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to the '_mysite_download_skin' parameter in the 'dl-skin.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any file within the server of the vulnerable service."
