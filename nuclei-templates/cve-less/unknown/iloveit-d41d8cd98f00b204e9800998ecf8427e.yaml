  name: "I LOVE IT! < 2.4 - Multiple Vulnerabilities"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The I LOVE IT!  theme is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in versions up to, and including, 2.3. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser, create fake content, and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information."
