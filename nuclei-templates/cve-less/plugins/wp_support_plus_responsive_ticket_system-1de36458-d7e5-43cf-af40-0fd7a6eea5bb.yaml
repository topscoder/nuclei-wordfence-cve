    WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System <= 8.0.7 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including 8.0.7. This is due to insufficient file type validation on the wpsp_upload_attachment AJAX action which makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files that could be used to obtain remote code execution.
