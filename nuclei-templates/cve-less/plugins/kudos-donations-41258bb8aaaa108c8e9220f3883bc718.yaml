  name: "Kudos Donations – Easy donations and payments with Mollie < 3.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Kudos Donations – Easy donations and payments with Mollie plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 3.1.2. This is due to incorrect nonce validation on the several delete functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily delete items via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
