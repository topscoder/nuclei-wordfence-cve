    Profile Builder – User Profile & User Registration Forms Plugin < 1.1.60 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Profile Builder – User Profile & User Registration Forms Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.1.59. This is due to a failure to restrict access on the password reset form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset passwords of user accounts, including administrator accounts.
