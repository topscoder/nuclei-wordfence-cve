info:
  name: "Post Connector <= 1.0.3 and Post Conector Premium <= 1.6.3 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Post Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping via add_query_arg and remove_query_arg. Post Connector Premium is also vulnerable, up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
