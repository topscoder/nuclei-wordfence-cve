    Backup Migration <= 1.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ajax() function, or BMI_Ajax class. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control any of the plugin's settings, and restore/delete/modify back-ups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
