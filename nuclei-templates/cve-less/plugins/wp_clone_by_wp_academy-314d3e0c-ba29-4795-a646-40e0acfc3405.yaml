    Clone <= 2.3.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wp_ajax_tifm_save_decision
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_ajax_tifm_save_decision function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the 'Test new plugins before installing' setting via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
