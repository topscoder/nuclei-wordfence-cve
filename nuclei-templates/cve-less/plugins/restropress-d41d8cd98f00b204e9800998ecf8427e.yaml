  name: "RestroPress <= 2.8.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cart Manipulation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The RestroPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the contents of other users' carts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
