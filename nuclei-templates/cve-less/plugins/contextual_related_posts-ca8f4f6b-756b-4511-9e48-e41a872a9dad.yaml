    Contextual Related Posts <= 3.3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in crpClearCache
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contextual Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the crpClearCache function triggered via the crp_clear_cache AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the Contextual Related Posts cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
