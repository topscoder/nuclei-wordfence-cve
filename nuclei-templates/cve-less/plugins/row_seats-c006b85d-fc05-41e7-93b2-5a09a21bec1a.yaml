    Row Seats Core < 2.68 - PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Row Seats Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.66 via deserialization of untrusted input from several parameters such as 'mycartitems'. This allows attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
