    BuddyPress <= 7.2.0 - Authorization Bypass to Friend Invite
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the buddypress/v1/groups/invites REST-API endpoint in versions up to, and including, 7.2.0. This makes it possible for a member to invite another member to join a group without being friends when that group restricted invites to friends only.
