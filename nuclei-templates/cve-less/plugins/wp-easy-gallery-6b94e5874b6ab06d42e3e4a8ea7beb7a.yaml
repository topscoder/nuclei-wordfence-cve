    WP Easy Gallery <= 2.7 - SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Easy Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the 'galleryId' or 'select_gallery' parameters found in the ‘admin/edit-gallery.php’ file in versions up to, and including, 2.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated admin+ attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
