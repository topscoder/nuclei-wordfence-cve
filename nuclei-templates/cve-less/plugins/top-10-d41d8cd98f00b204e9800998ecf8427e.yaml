  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Top 10 – Popular posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the tptn_ajax_clearcache function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the plugin's cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
