    Jetpack <= 3.5.2 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Jetpack plugin for WordPress, in versions up to 3.5.2, is vulnerable to DOM based Cross-Site Scripting via the file genericons/example.html. This vulnerability allowed unauthenticated users to execute JavaScript in a visitor's browser provided they were able to trick them into clicking on a carefully crafted link. Executing JavaScript in an administrative user was possible if the victim was logged on to the affected site as an administrator.
