    WP e-Commerce – Store Toolkit <= 2.0.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP e-Commerce – Store Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check in the ~/store-toolkit.php file in versions up to, and including 2.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform actions like resetting file download sales in addition to other sensitive administrative actions.
