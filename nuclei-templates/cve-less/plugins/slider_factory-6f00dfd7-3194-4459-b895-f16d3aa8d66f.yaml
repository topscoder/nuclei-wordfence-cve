    Responsive Image Slider, Photo Gallery And Carousel < 1.3.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Responsive Image Slider, Photo Gallery And Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the sf_clone_slider, sf_save_slider, and sf_remove_slider functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clone, save and/or remove sliders via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
