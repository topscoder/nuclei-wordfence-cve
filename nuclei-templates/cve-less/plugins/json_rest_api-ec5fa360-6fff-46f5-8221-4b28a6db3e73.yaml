    JSON REST API <= 1.1 - Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The JSON REST API plugin for WordPress is possibly vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1 due to a potential SOP bypass. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to conduct JSON Flash attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
