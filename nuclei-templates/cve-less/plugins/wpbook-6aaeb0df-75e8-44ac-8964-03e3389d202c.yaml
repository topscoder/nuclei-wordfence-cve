    WPBook <= 2.7 - Unauthenticated Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPBook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpbook_subpanel() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify a vulnerable sites Facebook connection via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
