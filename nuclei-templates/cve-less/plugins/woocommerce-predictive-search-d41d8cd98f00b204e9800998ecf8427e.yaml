  name: "Predictive Search for WooCommerce <= 1.0.5 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Predictive Search for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via the predictive search box in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
