    WP Spell Check <= 9.12 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Spell Check plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 9.12. This is due to missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete ignored words via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
