  name: "Fancy Product Designer <= 4.5.0 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0 due to insufficient file sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
