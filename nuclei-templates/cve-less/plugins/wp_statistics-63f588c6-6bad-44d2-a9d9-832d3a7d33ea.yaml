    WP Statistics <= 12.0.8.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Statistics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 12.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the IP parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
