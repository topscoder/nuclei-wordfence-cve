    SP Project & Document Manager <= 2.5.9.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.9.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on various functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several actions such as modifying plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
