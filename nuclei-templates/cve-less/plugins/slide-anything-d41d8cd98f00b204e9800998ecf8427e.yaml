  name: "Slide Anything – Responsive Content / HTML Slider and Carousel <= 2.3.46 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Slide Anything – Responsive Content / HTML Slider and Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the post title parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.3.46 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
