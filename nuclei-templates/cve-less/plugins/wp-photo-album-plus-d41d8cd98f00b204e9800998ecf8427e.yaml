  name: "WP Photo Album Plus <= 5.4.7 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'zip' parameter in versions up to, and including, 5.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
