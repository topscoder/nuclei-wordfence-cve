    Quiz And Survey Master <= 7.3.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.3.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear audit data and perform other actions, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
