    Revive Old Posts – Social Media Auto Post and Scheduling Plugin < 8.0.0 - Authorization Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Revive Old Posts – Social Media Auto Post and Scheduling Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authorization Bypass due to a missing capability check on the update_response AJAX action in versions before 8.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a new account with administrative-level privileges. This issue was not fully patched until the core.php file was removed in version 8.0.0 since the capability check implemented (is_admin) was not sufficient.
