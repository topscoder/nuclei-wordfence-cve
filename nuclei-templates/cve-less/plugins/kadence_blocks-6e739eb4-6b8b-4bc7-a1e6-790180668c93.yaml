    Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP – Page Builder Features <= 3.5.32 - Incorrect Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Post Publication
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP – Page Builder Features plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post publication in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.32 due to a misconfigured capability check on the 'get_items_permission_check' function permission callback of the 'process_pattern' REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to create and immediately publish posts of any type (including pages), bypassing the standard WordPress review workflow where contributors must submit posts for administrator approval.
