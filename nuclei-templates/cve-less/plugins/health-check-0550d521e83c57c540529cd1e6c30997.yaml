  name: "Health Check & Troubleshooting <= 1.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via health_check_troubleshoot_get_captures"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the health_check_troubleshoot_get_captures function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable plugins and themes, dismiss notices, or disable troubleshooting mode when the site is in troubleshooting mode via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
