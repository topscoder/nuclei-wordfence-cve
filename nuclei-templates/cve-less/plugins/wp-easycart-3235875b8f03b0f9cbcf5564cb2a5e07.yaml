  name: "Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store <= 5.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ec_admin_ajax_save_design_settings' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary design settings on the vulnerable service via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
