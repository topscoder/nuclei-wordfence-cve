    NMI Gateway For WooCommerce <= 1.6.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NMI Gateway For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'bng701_stepOne_addBilling', 'bng701_stepOne' and 'bng701_deletePaymentMethod' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to other users' accounts and perform unwanted actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
