    Spam Free WordPress <= 1.9.3 - IP Protection Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Spam Free WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Protection Bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.9.3 via the sfw_comment_post_authentication() function due to the fact that the plugin relies on a value that can be user-supplied ('comment_ip' parameter) for the IP address that is checked against the blocklist. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass comment restrictions
