  name: "NextGEN Gallery Sell Photo <= 1.0.4 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The NextGEN Gallery Sell Photo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Button Text/Image' field in the settings page in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
