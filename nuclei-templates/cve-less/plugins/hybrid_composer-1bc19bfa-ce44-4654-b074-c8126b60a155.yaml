    Hybrid Composer <= 1.4.6 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Hybrid Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the hc_ajax_save_option function in versions up to, and including, 1.4.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to fully access and modify administrative settings/actions.
