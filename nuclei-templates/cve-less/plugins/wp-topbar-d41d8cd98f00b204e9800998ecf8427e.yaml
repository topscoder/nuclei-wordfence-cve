  name: "WP-TopBar <= 4.02 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP-TopBar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.02. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the admin pages. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access and perform subsequent Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
