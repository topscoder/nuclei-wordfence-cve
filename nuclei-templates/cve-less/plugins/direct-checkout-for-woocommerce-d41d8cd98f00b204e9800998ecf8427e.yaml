  name: "Direct Checkout for WooCommerce – Skip Cart with Buy Buttons <= 1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Direct Checkout for WooCommerce – Skip Cart with Buy Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
