    All-in-One WP Migration <= 7.14 - Unauthenticated Backup Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary back-up downloads due to insufficient filename randomization that made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute force back-up filenames in unique situations in versions up to, and including, 7.14. This would make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to discover information from files contained in the back-ups that could be used to aid further attacks or lead to simply sensitive information disclosure.
