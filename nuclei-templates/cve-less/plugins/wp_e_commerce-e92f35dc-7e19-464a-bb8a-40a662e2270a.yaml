    WP eCommerce <= 3.8.14.3 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP eCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on various functions called via AJAX actions and admin_init hooks in versions up to, and including, 3.8.14.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a plethora of actions like exporting sensitive user information, modifying the plugin's settings, and more.
