    WP Job Manager <= 1.31.2 - PHP Object Injection via PHAR Deserialization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    TheWP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.31.2 via deserialization of user-controlled input allowing a phar wrapper. This allows attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
