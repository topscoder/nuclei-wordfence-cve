    Health Check & Troubleshooting <= 1.2.3 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized execution of AJAX actions by subscriber level users and above in versions up to, and including 1.2.3. This is due to missing capability checks on the various functions hooked via AJAX actions in the plugin and can lead to attackers performing a variety of unauthorized actions.
