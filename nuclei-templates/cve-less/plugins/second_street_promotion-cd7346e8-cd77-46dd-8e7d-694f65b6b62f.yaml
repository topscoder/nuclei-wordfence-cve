    Second Street <= 3.1.6 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via organization_id
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The plugin Second Street for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the organization_id parameter in versions up to and including 3.1.6 due to insufficient output escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
