    White Label CMS <= 1.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The White Label CMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wlcmsImport' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
