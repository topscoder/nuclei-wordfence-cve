    WooCommerce Affiliate Plugin – Coupon Affiliates < 4.11.3.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Affiliate Plugin – Coupon Affiliates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 4.11.3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete_click_entry function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily delete referral visits via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
