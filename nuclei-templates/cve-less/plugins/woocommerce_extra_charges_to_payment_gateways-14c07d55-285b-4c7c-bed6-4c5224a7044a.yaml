    Extra Charges To Payment Gateway For WooCommerce <= 2.0.2.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Extra Charges To Payment Gateway For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the add_form_fields() method, hooked to the admin_head action in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthorized (subscriber-level) attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
