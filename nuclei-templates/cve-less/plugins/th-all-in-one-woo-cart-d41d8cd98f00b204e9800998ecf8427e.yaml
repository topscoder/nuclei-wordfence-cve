  name: "TH Side Cart and Menu Cart for Woocommerce <= 1.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The TH Side Cart and Menu Cart plugin for WordPress  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the functions taiowc_form_setting, delete_settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
