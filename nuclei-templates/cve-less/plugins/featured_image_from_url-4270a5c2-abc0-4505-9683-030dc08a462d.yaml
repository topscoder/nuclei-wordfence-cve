    Featured Image from URL <= 2.7.7 - Missing Authorization on REST API routes
  author: topscoder
  severity: high

    The Feature Image from URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on REST routes in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access the vulnerable endpoints.
