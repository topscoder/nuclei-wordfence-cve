    Email Tracker – Email Tracking Plugin to track Emails for Open and Email Links Click (Compatible with WooCommerce) < 5.2.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Email Tracker – Email Tracking Plugin to track Emails for Open and Email Links Click (Compatible with WooCommerce) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘page’ parameter in versions before 5.2.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
