    SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress <= 2.2.1 - Unauthenticated Stripe Payment Amount Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to the plugin accepting the payment amount directly from user-controlled POST data in the 'create_payment_intent' and 'create_subscription_intent' functions without validating it against the form's configured price. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the payment amount to any arbitrary value when submitting a Stripe payment form, potentially purchasing products or services at significantly reduced prices.
