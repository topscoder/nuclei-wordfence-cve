    eBay Dropshipping and Affiliate by Wooshark <= 1.5.6 - Unprotected AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The eBay Dropshipping and Affiliate by Wooshark plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several functions located in the ~/woocommerce-reviews-manager_init.php file that are called via nopriv AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to perform a wide variety of actions such as importing new products.
