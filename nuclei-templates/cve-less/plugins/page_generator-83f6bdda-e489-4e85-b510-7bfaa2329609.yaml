    Page Generator <= 1.6.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Keywords Deletion/Duplication
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Page Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate or deleted keywords granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
