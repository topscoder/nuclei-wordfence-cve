    Ultimate Auction <= 4.0.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Auction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions and missing sanitization and escaping on several parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise unauthorized access and perform subsequent attacks such as XSS via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
