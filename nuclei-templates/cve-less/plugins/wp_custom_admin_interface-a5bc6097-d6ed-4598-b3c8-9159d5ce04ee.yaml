    WP Custom Admin Interface <= 7.32 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Transients Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Custom Admin Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.32. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_custom_admin_interface_delete_transients function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete plugin transients via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
