    BuddyPress <= 7.2.1 - Missing Authorization to Private Post Activity
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.2.1. This is due to missing authorization validation on the activity REST-API Endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to favorite private and hidden activity they are not authorized to access.
