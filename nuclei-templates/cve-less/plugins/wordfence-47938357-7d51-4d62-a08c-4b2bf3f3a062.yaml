    Wordfence Security <= 5.2.3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via HTTP_HOST
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Wordfence Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the  '$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']' in PHP in versions up to, and including, 5.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthorized attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
