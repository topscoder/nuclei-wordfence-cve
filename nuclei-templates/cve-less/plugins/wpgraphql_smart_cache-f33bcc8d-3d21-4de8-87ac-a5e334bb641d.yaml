    WPGraphQL Smart Cache < 2.0.1 - Unauthenticated Private Content Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPGraphQL Smart Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to 2.0.1 (exclusive) via the query endpoint due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
