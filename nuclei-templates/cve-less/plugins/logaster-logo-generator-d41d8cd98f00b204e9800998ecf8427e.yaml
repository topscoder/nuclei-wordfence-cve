info:
  name: "Logaster Logo Generator <= 1.3 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Media Deletion and Creation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Logaster Logo Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the upload_logo_callback and delete_logo_callback functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions such as a subscriber to delete arbitrary media files and upload arbitrary media files."
