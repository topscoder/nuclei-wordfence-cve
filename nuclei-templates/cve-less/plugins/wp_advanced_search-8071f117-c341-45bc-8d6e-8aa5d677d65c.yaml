    WordPress WP-Advanced-Search <= 3.3.3 - Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WordPress WP-Advanced-Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 via the WP_Advanced_Search_Import() function which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server through a file upload. This is due to the WP_Advanced_Search_Import() function being hooked via an admin_post_nopriv action that is available to all users.
