    Knews Multilingual Newsletters < 1.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Knews Multilingual Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
