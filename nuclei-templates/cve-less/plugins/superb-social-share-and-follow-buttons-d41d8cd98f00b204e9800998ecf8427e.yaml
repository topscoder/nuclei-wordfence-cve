  name: "Superb Social Media Share Buttons and Follow Buttons <= 1.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via spbsmAjax"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Superb Social Media Share Buttons and Follow Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the spbsmAjax function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
