    ProductX – Gutenberg WooCommerce Blocks – WooCommerce Builder, Wishlist for WooCommerce, Products Comparison, Quick View, Online Store – All in One Solution <= 2.2.5 - Multiple Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    ProductX – Gutenberg WooCommerce Blocks – WooCommerce Builder, Wishlist for WooCommerce, Products Comparison, Quick View, Online Store – All in One Solution in versions up to and including 2.2.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
