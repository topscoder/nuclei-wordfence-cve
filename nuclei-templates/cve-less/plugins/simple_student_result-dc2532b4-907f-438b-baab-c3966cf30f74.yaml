    Student Result or Employee Database <= 1.7.9 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Student Results or Employee Database plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized REST calls in versions up to, and including 1.7.9. This is due to flawed permission callback in the plugin's REST endpoints. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to utilize these endpoints to add, modify or delete students
