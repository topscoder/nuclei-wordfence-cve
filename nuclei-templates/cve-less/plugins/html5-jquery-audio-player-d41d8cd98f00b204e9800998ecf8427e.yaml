  name: "HTML5 jQuery Audio Player <= 2.6.2 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The HTML5 jQuery Audio Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2 due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
