    Post Grid <= 2.0.12 - Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion in versions up to, and including, 2.0.12. This is due to the plugin failing to properly verify user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete files on the vulnerable service.
