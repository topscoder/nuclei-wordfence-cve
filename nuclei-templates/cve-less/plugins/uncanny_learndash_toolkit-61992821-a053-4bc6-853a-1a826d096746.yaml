    Uncanny Toolkit for LearnDash <= 3.6.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Uncanny Toolkit for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.6.3. This is due to missing  nonce validation on several functions such as the ajax_activate_deactivate_module function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
