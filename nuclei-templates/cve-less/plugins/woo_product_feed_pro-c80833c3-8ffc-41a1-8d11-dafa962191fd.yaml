    Product Feed PRO for WooCommerce <= 12.4.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Product Feed PRO for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 12.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions such as woosea_enable_structured_data, woosea_structured_vat, woosea_add_manipulation, woosea_add_aelia, and more. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several plugin options and settings, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
