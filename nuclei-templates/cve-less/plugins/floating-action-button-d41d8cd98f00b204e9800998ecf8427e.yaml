info:
  name: "Floating Action Button <= 1.2 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Floating Action Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to a missing capability check and nonce validation on the fz_fab_settings_save() function that is called via an AJAX action (including a nopriv action). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings."
