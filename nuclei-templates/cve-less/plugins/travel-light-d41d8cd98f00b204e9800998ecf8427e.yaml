  name: "Travel Light <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Travel Light for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'booktrip', 'filter_plcbrd_action', 'filter_plcservice_action', 'filter_action' and 'filter_service_action' AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
