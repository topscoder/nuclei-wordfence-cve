info:
  name: "leads5050-visitor-insights <= 1.0.5 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The leads5050-visitor-insights plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the leads5050_set_license function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to edit the license data in the plugin's settings."
