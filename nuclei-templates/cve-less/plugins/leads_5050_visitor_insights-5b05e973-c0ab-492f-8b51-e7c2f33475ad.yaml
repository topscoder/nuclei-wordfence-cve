    leads5050-visitor-insights < 1.0.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary License Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Leads5050 Visitor Insights plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary License Change in versions before 1.0.4. This is due to insufficient access control on the leads5050_set_license AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set and modify arbitrary licenses in the plugin settings.
