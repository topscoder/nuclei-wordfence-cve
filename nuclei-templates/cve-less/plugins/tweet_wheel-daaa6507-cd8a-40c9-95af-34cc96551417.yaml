    Tweet Wheel <= 0.2 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Tweet Wheel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to several functions called via AJAX actions missing proper capability and nonce checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to spam Twitter with an arbitrary amount of previously posted tweets among some additional less impactful actions.
