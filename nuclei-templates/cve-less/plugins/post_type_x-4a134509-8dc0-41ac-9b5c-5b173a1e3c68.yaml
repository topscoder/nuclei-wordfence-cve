    Product Catalog Simple <= 1.7.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via ic_system_status
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Product Catalog Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ic_system_status function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset product settings, delete products, delete product categories, delete old filters, and reassign product data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
