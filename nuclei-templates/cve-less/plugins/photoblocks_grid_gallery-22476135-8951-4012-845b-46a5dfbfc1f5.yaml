    Gallery PhotoBlocks <= 1.1.5 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 via several parameters due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
