    Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On <= 1.2.4 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'pmpro_courses_modules' setting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. This can also be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery.
