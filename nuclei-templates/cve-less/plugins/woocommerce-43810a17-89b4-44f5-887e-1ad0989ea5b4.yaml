    WooCommerce < 8.4.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions before 8.4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. IMPORTANT: There was a miscommunication and error in this vulnerability record where we initially reported version 8.5.0 as patched, while 8.4.0 was still vulnerable. This issue was patched in version 8.4.0 and only affects versions up to 8.3.0. Please rest assured knowing you can update the plugin to version 8.4.0 and this issue will be patched.
