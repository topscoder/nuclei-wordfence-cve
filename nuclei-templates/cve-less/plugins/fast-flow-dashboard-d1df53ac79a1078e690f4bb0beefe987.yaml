  name: "Fast Flow <= 1.2.11 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Fast Flow WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.11, via the 'p' parameter due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
