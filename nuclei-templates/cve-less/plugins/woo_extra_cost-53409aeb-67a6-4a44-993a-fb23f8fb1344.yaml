    WooCommerce Extra Cost <= 2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Extra Cost plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_extra_cost' method. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
