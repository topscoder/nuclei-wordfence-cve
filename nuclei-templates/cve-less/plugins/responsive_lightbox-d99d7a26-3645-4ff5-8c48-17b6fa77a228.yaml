    Responsive Lightbox & Gallery <= 2.4.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘sanitize_field’ function in versions up to, and including, 2.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on text fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
