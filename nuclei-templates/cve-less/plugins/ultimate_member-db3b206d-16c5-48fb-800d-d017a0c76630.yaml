    Ultimate Member <= 2.1.6 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirects in versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 This is due to insufficient redirect location validation which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trick victims into accessing malicious sites granted they can trick the victim into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
