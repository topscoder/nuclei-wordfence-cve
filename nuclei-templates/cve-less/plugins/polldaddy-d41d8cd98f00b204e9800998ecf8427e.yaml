  name: "Crowdsignal Dashboard < 2.0.21 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Crowdsignal Dashboard – Polls, Surveys & more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 2.0.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the rating_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to have an unknown impact via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
