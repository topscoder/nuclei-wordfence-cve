    Quiz And Survey Master <= 8.1.18 - Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master – Best Quiz, Exam and Survey Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to show disabled contact fields and delete quiz results via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
