  name: "WooCommerce Reviews Plugin with Multi-criteria Rating by ReviewX < 1.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WooCommerce Reviews Plugin with Multi-criteria Rating by ReviewX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.2.9. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/app/Controllers/Storefront/ReviewxPublic.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized AJAX actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
