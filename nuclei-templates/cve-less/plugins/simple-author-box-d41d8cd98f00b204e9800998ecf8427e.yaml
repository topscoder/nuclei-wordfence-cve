  name: "Simple Author Box <= 2.50 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via save_user_profile"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Simple Author Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.50. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_user_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit user profile settings of other users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
