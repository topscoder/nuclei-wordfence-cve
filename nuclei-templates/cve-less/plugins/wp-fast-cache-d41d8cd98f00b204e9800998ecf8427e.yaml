  name: "WP Fast Cache <= 1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP Fast Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the 'wp_fast_cache_bulk_action_url' variable not being sanitized or escapes. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions and perform subsequent Cross-Site Scripting attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
