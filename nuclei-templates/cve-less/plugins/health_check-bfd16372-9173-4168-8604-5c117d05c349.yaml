    Health Check & Troubleshooting <= 1.2.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to call AJAX actions (vulnerable actions listed in resource) via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
