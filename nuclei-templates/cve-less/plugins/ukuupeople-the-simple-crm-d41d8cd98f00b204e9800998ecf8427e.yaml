  name: "CRM: Contact Management Simplified – UkuuPeople <= 1.6.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Favorite Addition/Deletion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The CRM: Contact Management Simplified – UkuuPeople plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ukuu_add_to_fav' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and delete any favorite posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
