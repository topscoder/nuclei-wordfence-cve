  name: "RSS Includes Pages <= 3.6 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The RSS Includes Pages plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via the 'REQUEST_URI' parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
