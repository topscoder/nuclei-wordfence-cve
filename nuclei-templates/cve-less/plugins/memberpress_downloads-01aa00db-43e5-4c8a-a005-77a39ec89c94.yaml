    MemberPress Downloads <= 1.2.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MemberPress Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and missing capabilities checks on one of its AJAX endpoints in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
