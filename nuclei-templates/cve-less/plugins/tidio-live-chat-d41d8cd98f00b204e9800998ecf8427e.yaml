  name: "Tidio Live Chat < 4.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Tidio Live Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the toggleAsync(), ajaxSetProjectKeys(), and uninstall() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, alongside performing other administrative actions, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
