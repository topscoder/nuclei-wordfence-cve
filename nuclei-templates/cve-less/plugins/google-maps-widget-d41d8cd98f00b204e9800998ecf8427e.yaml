  name: "Maps Widget for Google Maps <= 4.23 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via dismiss_notice"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Maps Widget for Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.23. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss_notice function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
