    WooCommerce Custom Registration Form <= 1.0.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Custom Registration Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the del_field and save_all_data functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit and delete registration forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
