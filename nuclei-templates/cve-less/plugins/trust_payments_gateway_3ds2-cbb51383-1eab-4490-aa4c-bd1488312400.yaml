    Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) <= 1.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions like tpgw_create_new_user() and tpgw_update_address_myst(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several different administrative actions via forged requests granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
