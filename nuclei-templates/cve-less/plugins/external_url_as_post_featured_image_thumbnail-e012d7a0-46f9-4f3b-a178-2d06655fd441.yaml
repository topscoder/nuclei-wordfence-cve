    External url as post Featured Image <= 2.02 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The plugin External url as post Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.02 due to the use of add_query_arg/remove_query_arg with insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a URL that executes if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
