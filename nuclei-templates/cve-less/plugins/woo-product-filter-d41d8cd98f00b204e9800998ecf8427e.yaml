  name: "Product Filter by WooBeWoo <= 1.4.9 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Product Filter by WooBeWoo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including 1.4.9 due to missing authorization checks on various functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as creating new filters and injecting malicious javascript into a vulnerable site. This was actively exploited at the time of discovery."
