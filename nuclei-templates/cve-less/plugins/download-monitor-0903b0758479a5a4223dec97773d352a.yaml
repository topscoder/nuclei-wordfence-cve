    Download Monitor <= 4.7.60 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated Data Export
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to an insufficient capability check on several REST-API routes related to reporting in versions up to, and including, 4.7.60. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to view user data and other sensitive information intended for administrators.
