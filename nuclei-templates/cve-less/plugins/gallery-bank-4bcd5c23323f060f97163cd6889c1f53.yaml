  name: "Gallery Bank – WordPress Photo Gallery Plugin < 2.0.20 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Gallery Bank – WordPress Photo Gallery Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘album_id’ parameter in edit_album.php and the 'recordsArray' parameter in the album_gallery_bank_class.php file in versions before 2.0.20 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
