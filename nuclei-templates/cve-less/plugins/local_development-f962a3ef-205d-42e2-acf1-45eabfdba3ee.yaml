    Local Development <=2.8.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Local Development plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
