  name: "Gallery – Photo Albums Plugin < 1.2.29 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Gallery – Photo Albums (formerly titled Easy Media Gallery) Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the spg_add_admin function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.28 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
