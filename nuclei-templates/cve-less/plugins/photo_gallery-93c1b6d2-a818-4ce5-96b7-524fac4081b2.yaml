    Photo Gallery by 10Web <= 1.6.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6 . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
