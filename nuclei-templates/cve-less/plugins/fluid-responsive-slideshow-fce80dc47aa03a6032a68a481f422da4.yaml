    Fluid Responsive Slideshow < 2.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Fluid Responsive Slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the frst_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit content on all pages and posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
