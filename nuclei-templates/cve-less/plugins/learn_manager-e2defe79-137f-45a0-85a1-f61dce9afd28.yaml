    WP LMS – Best WordPress LMS Plugin <= 1.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP LMS – Best WordPress LMS Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and edit user-related data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
