  name: >
    Recipe Card Blocks by WPZOOM <= 2.8.2 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Recipe Card Blocks by WPZOOM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.8.2 by not properly sanitizing or escaping some of the properties of the Recipe Card Block (such as ingredientsLayout, iconSet, steps, ingredients, recipeTitle, or settings). This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
