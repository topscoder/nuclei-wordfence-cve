info:
  name: >
    All In One WP Security & Firewall <= 4.4.10 - Open Redirect and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All In One WP Security & Firewall WordPress plugin before 4.4.11 does not validate, sanitise and escape the redirect_to parameter before using it to redirect user, either via a Location header, or meta url attribute, when the Rename Login Page is active, which could lead to an Arbitrary Redirect as well as Cross-Site Scripting issue. Exploitation of this issue requires the Login Page URL value to be known, which should be hard to guess, reducing the risk
