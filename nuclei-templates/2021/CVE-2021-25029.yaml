  name: >
    CLUEVO E-Learning Platform <= 1.8.0 - Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The CLUEVO LMS, E-Learning Platform WordPress plugin before 1.8.1 does not sanitise and escape Course's module, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed
    The CLUEVO E-Learning Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Course's module. This makes it possible for high privilege attackers, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
