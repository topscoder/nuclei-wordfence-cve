  name: >
    WP User Manager <= 2.6.2 - Arbitrary User Password Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP User Manager WordPress plugin before 2.6.3 does not ensure that the user ID to reset the password of is related to the reset key given. As a result, any authenticated user can reset the password (to an arbitrary value) of any user knowing only their ID, and gain access to their account.
