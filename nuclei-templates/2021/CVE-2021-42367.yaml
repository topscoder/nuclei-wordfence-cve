  name: >
    Variation Swatches for WooCommerce <= 2.1.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in the ~/includes/class-menu-page.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.1.1. Due to missing authorization checks on the tawcvs_save_settings function, low-level authenticated users such as subscribers can exploit this vulnerability.
