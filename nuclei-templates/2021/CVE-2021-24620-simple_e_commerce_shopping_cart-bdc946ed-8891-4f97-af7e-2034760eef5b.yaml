    Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal <= 3.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the simpleecommcart-products page, and missing file type validation on the Downloadable Digital product file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
