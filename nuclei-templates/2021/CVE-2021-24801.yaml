info:
  name: >
    WP Survey Plus <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Survey Plus WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in place in its AJAX actions, allowing any user to call them and add/edit/delete Surveys. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitization in the Surveys' Title, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues.
