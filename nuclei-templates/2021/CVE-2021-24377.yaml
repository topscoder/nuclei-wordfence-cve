info:
  name: >
    Autoptimize <= 2.7.7 - Race Condition leading to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Autoptimize WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 attempts to remove potential malicious files from the extracted archive uploaded via the 'Import Settings' feature, however this is not sufficient to protect against RCE as a race condition can be achieved in between the moment the file is extracted on the disk but not yet removed. It is a bypass of CVE-2020-24948.
