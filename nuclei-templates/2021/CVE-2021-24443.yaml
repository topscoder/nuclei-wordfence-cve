id: CVE-2021-24443

info:
  name: >
    Youzify <= 1.0.6 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The About Me widget of the Youzify – BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership WordPress plugin before 1.0.7 does not properly sanitise its Biography field, allowing any authenticated user to set Cross-Site Scripting payloads in it, which will be executed when viewing the affected user profile. This could allow a low privilege user to gain unauthorised access to the admin side of the blog by targeting an admin, inducing them to view their profile with a malicious payload adding a rogue account for example.
