  name: >
    KJM Admin Notices <= 2.0.1 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The KJM Admin Notices WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/admin/class-kjm-admin-notices-admin.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.0.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
