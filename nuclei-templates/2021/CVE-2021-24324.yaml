    404 SEO Redirection <= 1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The 404 SEO Redirection WordPress plugin through 1.3 is lacking CSRF checks in all its settings, allowing attackers to make a logged in user change the plugin's settings. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping in some fields, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues
