info:
  name: >
    Enqueue Anything <= 1.0.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Enqueue Anything WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the remove_asset AJAX action, and does not ensure that the item to be deleted is actually an asset. As a result, low privilege users such as subscriber could delete arbitrary assets, as well as put arbitrary posts in the trash.
