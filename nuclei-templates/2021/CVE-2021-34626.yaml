  name: >
    WP Upload Restriction <= 2.2.4 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Upload Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the deleteCustomType function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions to delete custom extensions that may have been added by site administrators.
