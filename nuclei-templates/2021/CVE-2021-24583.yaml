info:
  name: >
    Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress <= 2.4.1 - Unauthorised Event TimeSlot Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability
