info:
  name: >
    NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder <= 8.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The NEX-Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_record() function, in addition to many other functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
