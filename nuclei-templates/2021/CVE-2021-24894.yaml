    Reviews Plus < 1.2.14 - Denial of Service
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Reviews Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Denial of Service in versions before 1.2.14. This is due to an unknown part of the file post/page of the component Rating Submission Handler. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a denial of service vulnerability. This makes it possible for authentication attackers, a authentication is necessary for exploitation to cause a Denial of Service in the review section when an authenticated user submit such rating and the reviews are set to be displayed on the post/page.
