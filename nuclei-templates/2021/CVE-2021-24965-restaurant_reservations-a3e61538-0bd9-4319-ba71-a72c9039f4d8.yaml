info:
  name: >
    Five Star Restaurant Reservations <= 2.4.7 - Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Five Star Restaurant Reservations WordPress plugin before 2.4.8 does not have capability and CSRF checks in the rtb_welcome_set_schedule AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users to call it. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, users with a role as low as subscriber could perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins
