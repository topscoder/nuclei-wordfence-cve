  name: >
    Contact Form Email <= 1.3.24 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form Email WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and escaping via the name parameter found in the ~/trunk/cp-admin-int-list.inc.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.3.24. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
