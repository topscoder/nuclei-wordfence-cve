id: CVE-2021-24362

info:
  name: "Photo Gallery <= 1.5.74 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Uploaded SVG"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery WordPress plugin before 1.5.75 did not ensure that uploaded SVG files added to a gallery do not contain malicious content. As a result, users allowed to add images to gallery can upload an SVG file containing JavaScript code, which will be executed when accessing the image directly (ie in the /wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/ folder), leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue"
