info:
  name: >
    Ultimate Member <= 2.1.19 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member – User Profile, User Registration, Login & Membership Plugin WordPress plugin before 2.1.20 did not properly sanitise, validate or encode the query string when generating a link to edit user's own profile, leading to an authenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue. Knowledge of the targeted username is required to exploit this, and attackers would then need to make the related logged in user open a malicious link.
