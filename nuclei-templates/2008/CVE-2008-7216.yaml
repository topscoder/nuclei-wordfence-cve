info:
  name: >
    Peter's Math Anti-Spam Spinoff < 1.0.0 - CAPTCHA Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Peter's Math Anti-Spam Spinoff plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CAPTCHA Bypass in versions up to 1.0.0. This is due to the plugin generating audio CAPTCHA clips by concatenating static audio files without any additional distortion. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the Captcha Verification by reading certain bytes from the generated clip.
