info:
  name: "Akismet Spam Protection < 2.0.2 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Akismet Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the _wp_http_referer’ parameter in versions before 2.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
