info:
  name: >
    Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk <= 2.50 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user interaction in versions up to, and including, 2.50. This is due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions and nonce disclosure in the source page of the administrative dashboard. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to call functions and delete and/or upload files.
