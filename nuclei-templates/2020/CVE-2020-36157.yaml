info:
  name: >
    Ultimate Member <= 2.1.11 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Roles
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    An issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin before 2.1.12 for WordPress, aka Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Roles. Due to the lack of filtering on the role parameter that could be supplied during the registration process, an attacker could supply the role parameter with a WordPress capability (or any custom Ultimate Member role) and effectively be granted those privileges.
