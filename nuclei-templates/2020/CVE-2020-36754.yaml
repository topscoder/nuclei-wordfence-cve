  name: >
    Paid Memberships Pro  <= 2.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the pmpro_page_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save pages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
