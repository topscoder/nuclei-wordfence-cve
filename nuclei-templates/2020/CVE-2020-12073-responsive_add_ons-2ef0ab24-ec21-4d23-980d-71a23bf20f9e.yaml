  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive Ready Sites Importer for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due missing capability checks on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.2.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as subscribers, to perform a variety of unauthorized actions such as importing site content.
