info:
  name: >
    IMPress for IDX Broker <= 2.6.1 - Authenticated Arbitrary Post Creation, Modification, and Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    An issue was discovered in the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin before 2.6.2 for WordPress. wrappers.php allows a logged-in user (with the Subscriber role) to permanently delete arbitrary posts and pages, create new posts with arbitrary subjects, and modify the subjects of existing posts and pages (via create_dynamic_page and delete_dynamic_page).  This is due to missing capability and nonce checks on two of its Ajax actions.
