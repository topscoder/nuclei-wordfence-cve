  name: >
    JetBackup – WP Backup, Migrate & Restore <= 1.3.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The JetBackup – WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.3.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the vulnerable site's server via a forged request, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
