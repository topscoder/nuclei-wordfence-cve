id: CVE-2016-10885

info:
  name: >
    WP Editor < 1.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to 1.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_settings() function, in addition to a few other functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and upload files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
