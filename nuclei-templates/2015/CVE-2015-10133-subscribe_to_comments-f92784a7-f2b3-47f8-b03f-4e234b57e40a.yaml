  name: >
    Subscribe to Comments <= 2.1.2 - Local File Includion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Subscribe to Comments for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 via the Path to header value. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. This same function can also be used to execute arbitrary PHP code.
