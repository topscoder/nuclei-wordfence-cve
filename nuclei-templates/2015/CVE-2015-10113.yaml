  name: >
    WooFramework Tweaks <= 1.0.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooFramework Tweaks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via a URL in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and the use of add_query_arg. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that the CVE has this recorded as an Open Redirect, however, this patch is related to Cross-Site Scripting.
