    Hunk Companion <= 1.8.5 -  Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Hunk Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation/activation due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated. This is a bypass to CVE-2024-9707.
