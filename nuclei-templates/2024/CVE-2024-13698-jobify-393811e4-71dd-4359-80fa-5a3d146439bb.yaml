    Jobify - Job Board WordPress Theme <= 4.2.7 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery, Arbitrary Image Upload, and Image Generation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Jobify - Job Board WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'download_image_via_ai' and 'generate_image_via_ai' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application to upload files in an image format, and to generate AI images using the site's OpenAI key.
