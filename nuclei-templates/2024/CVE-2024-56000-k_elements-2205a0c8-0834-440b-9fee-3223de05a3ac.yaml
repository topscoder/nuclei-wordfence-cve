  name: >
    K Elements <= 5.3.9 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The K Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.9. This is due to the kleo_fb_intialize() function not having sufficient identity verification prior to authenticating a user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, granted they have access to their email.
