    WordPress File Upload <= 4.25.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in wfu_file_details
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.25.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wfu_file_details' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify user data details associated with uploaded files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
