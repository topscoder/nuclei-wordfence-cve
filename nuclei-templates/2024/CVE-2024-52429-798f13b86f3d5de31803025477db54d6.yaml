    WP Quick Setup <= 2.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin/Theme Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Quick Setup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin and theme installation due to a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins and themes which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
