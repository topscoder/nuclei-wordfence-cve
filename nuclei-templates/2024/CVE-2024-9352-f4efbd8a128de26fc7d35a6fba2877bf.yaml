    Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder <= 1.35.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Draft Custom Form Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.35.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the custom form 'create_module' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create draft forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
