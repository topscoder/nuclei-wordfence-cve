  name: >
    Crypto <= 2.15 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.15. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'crypto_connect_ajax_process::check' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
