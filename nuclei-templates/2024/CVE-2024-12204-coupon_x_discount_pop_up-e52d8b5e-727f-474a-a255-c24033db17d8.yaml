    Coupon X: Discount Pop Up, Promo Code Pop Ups, Announcement Pop Up, WooCommerce Popups <= 1.3.5 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Coupon X: Discount Pop Up, Promo Code Pop Ups, Announcement Pop Up, WooCommerce Popups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions in the class-cx-rest.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create 100% off coupons, delete posts, delete leads, and update coupon statuses.
