info:
  name: >
    Acnoo Flutter API <= 1.0.5 - Authentication Bypass via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Acnoo Flutter API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identify prior to allowing them to access an account. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators.
