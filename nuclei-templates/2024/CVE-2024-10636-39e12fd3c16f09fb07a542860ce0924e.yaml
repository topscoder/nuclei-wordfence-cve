    Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency <= (Multiple Versions)  - Reflected DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting via content
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘content’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
