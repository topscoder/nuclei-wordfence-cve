    School Management System – SakolaWP <= 1.0.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Exam Setting Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The School Management System – SakolaWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_exam_setting' and 'delete_exam_setting' actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update exam settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
