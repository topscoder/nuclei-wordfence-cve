    Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking with Visual Seat Plan and ultimate Calendar Scheduling Plugin <= 1.0.21 - Missing Authorization to Limited Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking with Visual Seat Plan and ultimate Calendar Scheduling plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the make_staff() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to grant users staff permissions. CVE-2024-37427 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
