    WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card <= 2.9.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'mwb_wgm_preview_mail' and 'mwb_wgm_woocommerce_add_cart_item_data' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that this may have been patched on an older version than 2.9.2, however, we do not have access to older versions of the software to confirm when the patch was added. The only patched version we have confirmed is 2.9.3.
