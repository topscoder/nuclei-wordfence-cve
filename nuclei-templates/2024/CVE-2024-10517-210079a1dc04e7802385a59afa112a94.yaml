    ProfilePress <= 4.15.14 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via "Labels"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Paid Membership Plugin, Ecommerce, User Registration Form, Login Form, User Profile & Restrict Content – ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via "Label" settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
