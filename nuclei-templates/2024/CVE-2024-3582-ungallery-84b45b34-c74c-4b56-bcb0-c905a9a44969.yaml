  name: >
    UnGallery <= 2.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The UnGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ungallerysettings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings and inject malicious webscripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
