  name: >
    Smart Forms <= 2.6.93 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Smart Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.93. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the smart-forms-ajax.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
