  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The CM Table Of Contents – WordPress TOC Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
