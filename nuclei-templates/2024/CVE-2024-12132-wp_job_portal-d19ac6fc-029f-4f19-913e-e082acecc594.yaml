  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Job Portal – A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4 due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create jobs for companies that are unaffiliated with the attacker.
