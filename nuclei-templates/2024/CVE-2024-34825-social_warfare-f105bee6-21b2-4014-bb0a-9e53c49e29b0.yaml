    Social Sharing Plugin – Social Warfare <= 4.4.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Social Sharing Plugin – Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the options_page_scan_url() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a scan via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
