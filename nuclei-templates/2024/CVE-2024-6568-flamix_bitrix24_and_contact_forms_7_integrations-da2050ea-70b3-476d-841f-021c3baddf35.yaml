    Flamix: Bitrix24 and Contact Form 7 integrations <= 3.1.0 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Flamix: Bitrix24 and Contact Form 7 integrations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.0. This is due the plugin utilizing mobiledetect without preventing direct access to the files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
