  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The KB Support – WordPress Help Desk and Knowledge Base plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in the /includes/ajax-functions.php file all versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform multiple administrative actions, such as replying to arbitrary tickets, updating the status of any post, deleting any post, adding notes to tickets, flagging or unflagging tickets, and adding or removing ticket participants.
