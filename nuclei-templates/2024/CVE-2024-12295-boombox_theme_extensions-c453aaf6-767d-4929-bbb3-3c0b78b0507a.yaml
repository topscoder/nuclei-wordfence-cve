    BoomBox Theme Extensions <= 1.8.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via Password Reset/Account Takeover in boombox_ajax_reset_password
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BoomBox Theme Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the 'boombox_ajax_reset_password' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level privileges and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
