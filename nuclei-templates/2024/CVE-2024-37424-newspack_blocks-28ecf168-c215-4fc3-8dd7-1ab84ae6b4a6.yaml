  name: >
    Newspack Blocks <= 3.0.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Newspack Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the iframe_accepted_file_mimes() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
