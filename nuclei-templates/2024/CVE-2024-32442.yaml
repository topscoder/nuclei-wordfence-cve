  name: >
    Zoho Campaigns <= 2.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via zcwc_integration_disconnect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Zoho Campaigns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the zcwc_integration_disconnect() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the integration via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
