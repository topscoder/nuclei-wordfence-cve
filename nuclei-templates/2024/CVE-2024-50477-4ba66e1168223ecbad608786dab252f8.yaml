    Stacks Mobile App Builder <= 5.2.3 - Authentication Bypass via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Stacks Mobile App Builder – The most powerful Mobile Applications Drag and Drop builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.3. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them via the receive_request_checkout() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user based on user ID.
