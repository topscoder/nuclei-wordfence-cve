  name: >
    WP Logs Book <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Log Disabling
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Logs Book plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disable logging via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
