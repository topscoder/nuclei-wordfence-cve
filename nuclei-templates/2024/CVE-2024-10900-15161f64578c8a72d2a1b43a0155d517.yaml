    ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities <= 5.9.3.6 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary User Meta Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pm_remove_file_attachment() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.3.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary user meta which can do things like deny an administrator's access to their site. .
