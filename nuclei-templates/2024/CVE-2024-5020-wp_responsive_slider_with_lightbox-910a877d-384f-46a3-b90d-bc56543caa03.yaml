    Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox <= 1.0.21 - Authenticated (Contributor+) DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via FancyBox in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
