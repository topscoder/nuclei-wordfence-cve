info:
  name: >
    Sendinblue for WooCommerce <= 4.0.17 - Authenticated (Editor+) Arbitrary File Download and Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Brevo for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file download and deletion in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.17. This is due to the plugin not properly validating file names in the get_file_contents and delete_attachment functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to download and delete arbitrary files.
