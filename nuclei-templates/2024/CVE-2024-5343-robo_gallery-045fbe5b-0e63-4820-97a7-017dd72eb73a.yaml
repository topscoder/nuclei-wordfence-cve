    Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery <= 3.2.19 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Post Creation and Limited Data Loss
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rbs_ajax_create_article' and 'rbs_ajax_reset_views' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
