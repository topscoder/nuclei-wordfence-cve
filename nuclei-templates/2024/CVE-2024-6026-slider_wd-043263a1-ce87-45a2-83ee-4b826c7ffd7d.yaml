    Slider by 10Web <= 1.2.55 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Slider by 10Web – Responsive Image Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.55 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
