    Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid – Visual Drag and Drop Editor <= 1.26.6 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid – Visual Drag and Drop Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.26.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping affecting the boldgrid_canvas_image AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
