    Formidable Registration <= 2.11 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary User Password Reset To Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WordPress User Registration Forms by Formidable Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary user password reset and account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.11. This is due to the plugin allowing users with access to the editor to utilize the frm-set-password-link shortcode and supply any user ID. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to reset the password of any user account and achieve account takeover
