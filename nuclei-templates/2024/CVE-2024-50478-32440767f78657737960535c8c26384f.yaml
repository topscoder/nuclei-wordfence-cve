    1-Click Login: Passwordless Authentication  1.4.5 - Authentication Bypass via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The 1-Click Login: Passwordless Authentication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in version 1.4.5. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators, granted they have access to an email.
