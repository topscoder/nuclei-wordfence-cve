    mFolio Lite <= 1.2.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) File Upload via EXE and SVG Files
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a missing capability check in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe file.
