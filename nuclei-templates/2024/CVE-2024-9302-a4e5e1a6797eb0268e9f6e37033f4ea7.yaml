    App Builder – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Flight <= 5.3.7 - Privilege Escalation and Account Takeover via Weak OTP
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The App Builder – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Flight plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.7. This is due to the verify_otp_forgot_password() and update_password() functions not having enough controls to prevent a successful brute force attack of the OTP to change a password, or verify that a password reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to change any users passwords, including an administrator.
