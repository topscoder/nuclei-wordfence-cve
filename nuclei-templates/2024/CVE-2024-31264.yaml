info:
  name: >
    Post Views Counter <= 1.4.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via save_bulk_post_views()
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post Views Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_bulk_post_views() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save bulk post views via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
