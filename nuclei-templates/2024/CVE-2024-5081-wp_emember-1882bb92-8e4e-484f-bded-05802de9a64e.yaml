    Wp EMember < 10.7.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wp EMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to 10.7.0 (exclusive). This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'eMember_settings_menu' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
