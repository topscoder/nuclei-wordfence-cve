    IdeaPush <= 8.71 - Missing Authorization to Board Term Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The IdeaPush plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the idea_push_taxonomy_save_routine function in all versions up to, and including, 8.71. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete terms for the "boards" taxonomy.
