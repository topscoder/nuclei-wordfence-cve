info:
  name: >
    Actionwear products sync <= 2.3.2 - Unauthenticated Full Patch Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Actionwear products sync plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. This is due the composer-setup.php file being publicly accessible with 'display_errors' set to true. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
