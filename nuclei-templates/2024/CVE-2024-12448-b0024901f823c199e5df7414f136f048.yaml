    Posts and Products Views for WooCommerce <= 2.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Posts and Products Views for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'papvfwc_views' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
