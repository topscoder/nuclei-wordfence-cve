    Modal Window – create popup modal window <= 5.3.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Modal Window – create popup modal window plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the modal-window page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete modals in bulk via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
