    Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle <= 2.10.30 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form widget addr2_width attribute
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form widget addr2_width attribute in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.30 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
