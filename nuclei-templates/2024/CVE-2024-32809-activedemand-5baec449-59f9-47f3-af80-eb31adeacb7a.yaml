    ActiveDEMAND <= 0.2.41 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The ActiveDEMAND plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the api_save_post() function in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.41. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
