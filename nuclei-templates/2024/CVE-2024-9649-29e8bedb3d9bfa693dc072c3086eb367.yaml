    WP ULike <= 4.7.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Statistic Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP ULike – The Ultimate Engagement Toolkit for Websites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_ulike_delete_history_api() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete engagements via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
