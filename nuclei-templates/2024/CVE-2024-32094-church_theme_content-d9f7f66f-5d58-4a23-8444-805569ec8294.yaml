  name: >
    Church Content – Sermons, Events and More <= 2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Church Content – Sermons, Events and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ctc_hide_theme_support_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to hide a theme support notice via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
