    Gutenberg Blocks and Page Layouts – Attire Blocks <= 1.9.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gutenberg Blocks and Page Layouts – Attire Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'attire-blocks/post-carousel' block in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
