    AI Engine <= 2.1.4 - Authenticated(Editor+) Arbitrary File Upload via add_image_from_url
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AI Engine: Chatbots, Generators, Assistants, GPT 4 and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'add_image_from_url' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. CVE-2024-29100 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
