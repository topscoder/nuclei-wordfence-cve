  name: >
    WPBookit <= 1.6.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary User Password Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
