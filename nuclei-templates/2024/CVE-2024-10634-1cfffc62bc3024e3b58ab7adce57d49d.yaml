    Nokaut Offers Box <= 1.4.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Setting Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Nokaut Offers Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
