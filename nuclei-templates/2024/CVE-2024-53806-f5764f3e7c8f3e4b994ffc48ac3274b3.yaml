    Maspik – Spam blacklist <= 2.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Maspik – Advanced Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
