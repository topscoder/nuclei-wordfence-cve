    Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter – Add Image Slider, Carousel Slider, Exit Intent Popup, Popup Modal, Coupon Popup, Post Slider Carousel <= 3.2.1- Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Slider and Carousel slider by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘addExtraMimeType’ function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
