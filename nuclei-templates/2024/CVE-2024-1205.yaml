  name: >
    Management App for WooCommerce – Order notifications, Order management, Lead management, Uptime Monitoring <= 1.2.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Management App for WooCommerce – Order notifications, Order management, Lead management, Uptime Monitoring plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the nouvello_upload_csv_file function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
