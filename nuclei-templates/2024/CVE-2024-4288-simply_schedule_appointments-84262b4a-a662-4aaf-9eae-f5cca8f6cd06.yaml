    Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin <= 1.6.7.14 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘link’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.6.7.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
