    Community by PeepSo – Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles <= 6.4.6.0 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo – Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.0. This is due to the plugin displaying errors and allowing direct access to the sse.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
