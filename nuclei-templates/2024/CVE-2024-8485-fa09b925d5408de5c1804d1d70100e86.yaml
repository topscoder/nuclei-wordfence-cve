    REST API TO MiniProgram <= 4.7.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary User Email Update and Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeovr in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 via the updateUserInfo() due to missing validation on the 'openid' user controlled key that determines what user will be updated. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary user's accounts, including their email to a @weixin.com email, which can the be leveraged to reset the password of the user's account, including administrators.
