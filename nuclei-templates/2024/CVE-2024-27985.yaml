id: CVE-2024-27985

info:
  name: >
    PropertyHive <= 2.0.9 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The PropertyHive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.9 via deserialization of untrusted input through the 'body' parameter. This makes it possible for attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
