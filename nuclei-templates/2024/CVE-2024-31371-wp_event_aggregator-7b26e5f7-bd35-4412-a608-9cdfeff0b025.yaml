    WP Event Aggregator <= 1.7.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wpea_deauthorize_user()
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Event Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpea_deauthorize_user() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove a meetup connection via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
