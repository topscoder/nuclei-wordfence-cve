  name: >
    WP Recipe Maker <= 9.2.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Video Embed
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Video Embed parameter in all versions up to, and including, 9.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the recipe dashboard (which is administrator-only by default but can be assigned to arbitrary capabilities), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
