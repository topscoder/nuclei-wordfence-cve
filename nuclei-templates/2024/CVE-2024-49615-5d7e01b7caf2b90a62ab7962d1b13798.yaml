    SafetyForms <= 1.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SafetyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL code into a query via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Due to the fact that the query results won't be displayed to the attacker, exploitation possibilities are limited.
