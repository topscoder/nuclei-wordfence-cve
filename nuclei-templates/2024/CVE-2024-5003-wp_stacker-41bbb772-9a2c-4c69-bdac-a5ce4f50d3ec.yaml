    WP Stacker <= 1.8.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Stacker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unknown action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. One possible impact leads to Cross-Site Scripting
