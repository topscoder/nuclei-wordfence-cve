  name: >
    Lawyer Landing Page <= 1.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Lawyer Landing Page theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the lawyer_landing_page_update_admin_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
