  name: >
    Responsive <= 5.0.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to 5.0.3.1 (exclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
