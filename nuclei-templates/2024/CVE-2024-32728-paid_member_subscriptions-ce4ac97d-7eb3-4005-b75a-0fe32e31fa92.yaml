    Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction <= 2.11.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss_notification() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notification via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
