    School Management System for Wordpress <= 93.0.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'mj_smgt_remove_feetype' and 'mj_smgt_remove_category_new' AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 93.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts.
