  name: >
    Paid Memberships Pro <= 2.12.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Level Orders Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro – Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the pmpro_update_level_order() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the order of levels via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
