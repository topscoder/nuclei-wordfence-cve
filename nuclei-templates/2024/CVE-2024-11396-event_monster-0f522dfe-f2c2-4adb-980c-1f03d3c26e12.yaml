    Event monster <= 1.4.3 - Information Exposure Via Visitors List Export
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Event Monster – Event Management, Tickets Booking, Upcoming Event plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 via the Visitors List Export file. During the export, a CSV file is created in the wp-content folder with a hardcoded filename that is publicly accessible. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data about event visitors, that includes first and last names, email, and phone number.
