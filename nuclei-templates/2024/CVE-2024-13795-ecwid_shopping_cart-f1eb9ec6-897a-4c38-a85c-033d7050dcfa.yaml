    Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart <= 6.12.27 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Send Deactivation Message
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.12.27. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ecwid_deactivate_feedback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send deactivation messages on behalf of a site owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
