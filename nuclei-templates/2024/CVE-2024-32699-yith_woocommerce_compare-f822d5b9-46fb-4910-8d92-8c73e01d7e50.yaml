    YITH WooCommerce Compare <= 2.37.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The YITH WooCommerce Compare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.37.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add/remove things from a product compare via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is marked as informational as there is no true security impact.
