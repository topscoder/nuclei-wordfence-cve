  name: >
    CP Media Player <= 1.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Player Deletion and Duplication
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The CP Media Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or duplicate existing audio or video players via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
