    Fastly <= 1.2.25 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Fastly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several unauthorized actions like testing connections and purging data.
