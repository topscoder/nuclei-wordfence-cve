  name: >
    Colibri WP <= 1.0.94 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Limited Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Colibri WP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.94. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the colibriwp_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install recommended plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
