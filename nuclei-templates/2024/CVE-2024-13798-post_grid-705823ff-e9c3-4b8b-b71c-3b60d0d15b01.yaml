  name: >
    Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks – ComboBlocks <= 2.3.5 - Unauthenticated Paid Order Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks – ComboBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized order creation in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This is due to insufficient verification on form fields. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new orders for products and mark them as paid without actually completing a payment.
