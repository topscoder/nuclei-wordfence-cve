  name: >
    Sync Post With Other Site <= 1.6 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Post Creation and Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Sync Post With Other Site plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'sps_add_update_post' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create new draft posts and update existing posts.
