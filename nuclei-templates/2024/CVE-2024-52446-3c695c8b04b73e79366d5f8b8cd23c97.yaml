    Buying Buddy IDX CRM <= 1.1.12 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Buying Buddy IDX CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.12. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject an object and execute magic methods in cases where a POP chain is present via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
