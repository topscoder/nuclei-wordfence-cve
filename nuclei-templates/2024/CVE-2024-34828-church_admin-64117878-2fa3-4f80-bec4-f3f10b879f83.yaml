  name: >
    Church Admin <= 4.1.32 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.32. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the includes/functions.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
