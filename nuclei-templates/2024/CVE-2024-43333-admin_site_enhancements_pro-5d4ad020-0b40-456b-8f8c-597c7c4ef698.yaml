  name: >
    Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) Pro <= 7.6.2.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.2.1. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting user's ability to utilize the “View Admin as Role” feature. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to recover access to a previous role, such as administrator, granted they had previously held a higher role. CVE-2025-24648 is a duplicate assignment of the same vulnerability.
