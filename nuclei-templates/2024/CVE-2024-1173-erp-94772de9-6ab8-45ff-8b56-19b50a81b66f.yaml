    WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings | WooCommerce CRM & Accounting <= 1.13.1 - Authenticated (AccountingManager+) SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings | WooCommerce CRM & Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with accounting manager or admin access, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
