  description: >
    The Popup Builder – Create highly converting, mobile friendly marketing popups. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
