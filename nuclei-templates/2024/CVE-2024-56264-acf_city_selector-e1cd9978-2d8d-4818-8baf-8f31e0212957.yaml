info:
  name: >
    ACF City Selector <= 1.14.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ACF City Selector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.14.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
