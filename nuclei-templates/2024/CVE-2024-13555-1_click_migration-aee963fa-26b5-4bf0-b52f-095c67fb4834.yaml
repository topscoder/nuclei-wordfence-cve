    1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time <= 2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Backup Process Cancellation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the cancel_actions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to cancel a triggered backup via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
