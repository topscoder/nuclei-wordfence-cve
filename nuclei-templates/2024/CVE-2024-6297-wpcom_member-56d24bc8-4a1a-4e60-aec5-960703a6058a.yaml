    Several WordPress.org Plugins <= Various Versions  - Injected Backdoor
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    Several plugins for WordPress hosted on WordPress.org have been compromised and injected with malicious PHP scripts. A malicious threat actor compromised the source code of various plugins and injected code that exfiltrates database credentials and is used to create new, malicious, administrator users and send that data back to a server. All plugins have received updates reverting any added malicious code. Simply Show Hooks affected version (1.2.1) is the same as the patched version (1.2.1) - it does not appear that the malicious copy was ever officially released, so sites running 1.2.1 should be unaffected, though it is a good idea to run a complete Wordfence scan and verify that there are no rogue administrator accounts present.
