    Himer <= 2.1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Group Leave
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Himer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpqa_leave_group AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force users to leave groups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
