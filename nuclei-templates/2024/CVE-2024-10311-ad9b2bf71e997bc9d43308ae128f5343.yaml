info:
  name: >
    External Database Based Actions <= 0.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The External Database Based Actions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to a missing capability check in the 'edba_admin_handle' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to update the plugin settings and log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.
