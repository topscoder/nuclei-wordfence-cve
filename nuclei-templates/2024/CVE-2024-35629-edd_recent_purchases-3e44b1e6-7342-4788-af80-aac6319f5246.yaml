    Easy Digital Downloads – Recent Purchases <= 1.0.2 - Unauthenticated Remote File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Easy Digital Downloads – Recent Purchases plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files hosted on external server,s allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution. This can only be exploited when allow_url_include is enabled.
