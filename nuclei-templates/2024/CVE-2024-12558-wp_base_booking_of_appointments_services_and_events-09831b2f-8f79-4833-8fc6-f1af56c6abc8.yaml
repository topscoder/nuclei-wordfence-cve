    WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events <= 4.9.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Information Exposure via app_export_db
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the export_db function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information from the database, such as the hashed administrator password.
