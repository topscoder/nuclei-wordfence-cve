  name: >
    AdForest <= 5.1.6 - Privilege Escalation via Password Reset/Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
