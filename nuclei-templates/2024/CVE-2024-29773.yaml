    BizPrint <= 4.5.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting via process.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The BizPrint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the process.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate invoices containing malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While the Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.4, making exploitation of cross-site scripting impractical, user inputs were not completely sanitized until version 4.5.6
