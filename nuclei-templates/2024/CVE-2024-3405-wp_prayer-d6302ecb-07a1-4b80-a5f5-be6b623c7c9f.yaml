  name: >
    WP Prayer <= 2.0.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Prayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpe_manage_settings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
