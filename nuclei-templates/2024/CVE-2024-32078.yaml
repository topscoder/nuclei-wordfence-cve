  name: >
    FV Flowplayer Video Player <= 7.5.44.7212 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized redirects in all versions up to, and including, 7.5.44.7212. This is due to the plugin not restricting contributor and above users from being able to add redirects at the end of videos. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to redirect administrators to arbitrary sites that can be malicious.
