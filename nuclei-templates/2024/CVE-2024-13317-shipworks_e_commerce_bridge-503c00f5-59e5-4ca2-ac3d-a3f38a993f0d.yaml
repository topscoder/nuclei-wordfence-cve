    ShipWorks Connector for Woocommerce <= 5.2.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Service Password/Username Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ShipWorks Connector for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'shipworks-wordpress' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the services username and password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
