  name: >
    Product Designer <= 1.0.33 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Attachment Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the product_designer_ajax_delete_attach_id() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.33. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary attachments. CVE-2024-38726 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
