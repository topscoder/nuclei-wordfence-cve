  name: >
    BEAR <= 1.1.4 - Authenticated (Shop manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Plugin Options
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BEAR – Bulk Editor and Products Manager Professional for WooCommerce by Pluginus.Net plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin options in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
