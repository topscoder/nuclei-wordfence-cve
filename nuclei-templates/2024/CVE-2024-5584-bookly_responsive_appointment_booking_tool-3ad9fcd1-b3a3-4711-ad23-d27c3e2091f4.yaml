    WordPress Online Booking and Scheduling Plugin – Bookly <= 23.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Color Profile Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WordPress Online Booking and Scheduling Plugin – Bookly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Color Profile parameter in all versions up to, and including, 23.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with the staff member role and Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
