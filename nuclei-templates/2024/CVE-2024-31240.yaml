  name: >
    WP Poll Maker <= 3.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Poll Maker – Best WordPress Poll Plugin for Voting Contest plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing capability check on the it_epoll_theme_action_uninstall() function and insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files that may make remote code execution possible.
