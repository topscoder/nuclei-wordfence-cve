    Youzify – BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership Plugin for WordPress By KaineLabs <= 1.3.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Review Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Youzify – BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the delete_user_review() and delete_review() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete other user's reviews.
