    WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti <= 1.9.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via process_bulk_action Function
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
