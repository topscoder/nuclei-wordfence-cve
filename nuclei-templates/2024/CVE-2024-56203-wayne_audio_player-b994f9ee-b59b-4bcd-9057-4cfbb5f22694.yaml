    Wayne Audio Player <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wayne Audio Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
