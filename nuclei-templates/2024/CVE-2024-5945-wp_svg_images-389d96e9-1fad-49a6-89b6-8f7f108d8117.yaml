  name: >
    WP SVG Images <= 4.3 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP SVG Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘type’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, who have permissions to upload sanitized files, to bypass SVG sanitization and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. A bypass to the patch in version 4.3 was discovered and fixed completely in version 4.4.
