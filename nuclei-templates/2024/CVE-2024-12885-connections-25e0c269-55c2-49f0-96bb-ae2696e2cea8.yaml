  name: >
    Connections Business Directory <= 10.4.66 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary Directory Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Connections Business Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary directory deletion due to insufficient file path validation when deleting a connections image directory in all versions up to, and including, 10.4.66. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary folders on the server and all their content.
