  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The s2Member – Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships, Content Restriction Paywalls & Member Access Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 241114 via the 'sc_get_details' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including user data and database configuration information, which can lead to reading, updating, or dropping database tables. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 241114.
