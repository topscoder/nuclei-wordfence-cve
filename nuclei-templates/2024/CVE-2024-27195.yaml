  name: >
    Watermark RELOADED <= 1.3.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via optionsPage
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Watermark RELOADED plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'optionsPage' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin options, which includes the ability to inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
