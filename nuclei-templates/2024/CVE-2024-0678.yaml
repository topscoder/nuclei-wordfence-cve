info:
  name: >
    Order Delivery Date for WP e-Commerce <= 1.2 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Order Delivery Date for WP e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'available-days-tf' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Please note this only affects the version of the "order-delivery-date" plugin for WP Ecommerce which was hosted in the WordPress repository and is discontinued now. The version of the plugin hosted off of the repository titled 'Order Delivery Date' for WooCommerce is not affected.
