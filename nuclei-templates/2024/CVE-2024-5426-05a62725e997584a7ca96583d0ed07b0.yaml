    Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery <= 1.8.23 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Zipped SVG
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘svg’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.23 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to use and configure Photo Gallery can be extended to contributors on pro versions of the plugin.
