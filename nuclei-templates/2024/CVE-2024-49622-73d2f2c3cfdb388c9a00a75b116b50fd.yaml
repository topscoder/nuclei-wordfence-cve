    Apa Banner Slider <= 1.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to SLQ Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Apa Banner Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL used in a query via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Since the result of such a query will be returned to the tricked user as opposed to the attacker, the severity of this vulnerability is reduced.
