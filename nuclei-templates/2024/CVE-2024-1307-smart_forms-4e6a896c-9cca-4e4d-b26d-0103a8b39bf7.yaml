    Smart Forms <= 2.6.93 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in the smart-forms-ajax.php file in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.93. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized actions.
