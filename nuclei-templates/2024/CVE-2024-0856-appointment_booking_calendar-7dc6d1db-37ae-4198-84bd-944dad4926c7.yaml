    Appointment Booking Calendar <= 1.3.82 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.82. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the cpabc_appointments.php page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform actions like adding bookings without paying via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
