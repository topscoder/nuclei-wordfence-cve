    Most And Least Read Posts Widget <= 2.5.18 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via most_and_least_read_posts_options
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Most And Least Read Posts Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the most_and_least_read_posts_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin options via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
