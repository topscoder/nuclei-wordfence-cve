  name: >
    WP Photo Album Plus <= 8.6.03.004 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wppa_user_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.03.004. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
