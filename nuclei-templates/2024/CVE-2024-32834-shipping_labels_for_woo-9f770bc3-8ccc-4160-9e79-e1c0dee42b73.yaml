  name: >
    WooCommerce Shipping Label <= 2.3.8 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Shipping Label plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
