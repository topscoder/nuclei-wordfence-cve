    JSP Store Locator <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Store Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The JSP Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete stores granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
