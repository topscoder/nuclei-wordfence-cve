    Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields <= 3.2.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Pod Form Redirect URL
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Pod Form widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
