    Five Star Restaurant Reviews <= 2.3.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Review URL
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Five Star Restaurant Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the review url parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
