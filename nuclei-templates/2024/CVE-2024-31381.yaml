    Spotlight Social Media Feeds <= 1.6.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Spotlight Social Media Feeds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the AuthCallbackListener class. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to connect accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
