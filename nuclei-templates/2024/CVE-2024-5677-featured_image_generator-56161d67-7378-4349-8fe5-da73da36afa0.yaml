  name: >
    Featured Image Generator <= 1.3.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Images Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Featured Image Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized image upload due to a missing capability check on the fig_save_after_generate_image function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary images to a post-related gallery.
