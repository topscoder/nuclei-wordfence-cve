    User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor <= 3.11.7 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Media Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file uplloads due to a missing capability check on the wppb_upload_file_type() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary media files via the async upload functionality.
