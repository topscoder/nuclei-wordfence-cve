  name: >
    Pubnews <= 1.0.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Pubnews theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the pubnews_importer_plugin_action_for_notice() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins that can be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities.
