    Responsive FlipBook Plugin Wordpress <= 2.5.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive FlipBook Plugin Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the rfbwp_save_settings() functionin all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
