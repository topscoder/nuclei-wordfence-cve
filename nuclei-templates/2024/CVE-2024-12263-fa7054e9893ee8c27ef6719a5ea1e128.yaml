    Child Theme Creator by Orbisius <= 1.5.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Cloud Snippet Update/Delete
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Child Theme Creator by Orbisius plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the cloud_delete() and cloud_update() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update and delete cloud snippets. Please note that this vulnerability was present in the Cloud Library Addon used by the plugin and not in the plugin itself, the cloud library has been removed entirely.
