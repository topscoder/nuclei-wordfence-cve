info:
  name: >
    WP JobSearch <= 2.6.7 - Authentication Bypass to Account Takeover and Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity when verifying an email address through the user_account_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators if the users email is known.
