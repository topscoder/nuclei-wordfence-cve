info:
  name: >
    MyBookTable Bookstore <= 3.3.7 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MyBookTable Bookstore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SEO post data in versions up to, and including, 3.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
