    Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms <= 2.3.41 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data via API due to an inconsistent capability check on several REST endpoints in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.41. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and higher, to obtain access to or modify forms or entries.
