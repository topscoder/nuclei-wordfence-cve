    WPDash Notes <= 1.3.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPDash Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wp_ajax_post_it_list_comment' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to view comments on any post, including private and password protected posts, and pending and draft posts if they were previously published. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.3.5.
