    MultiManager WP – Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily <= 1.0.5 - Authentication Bypass via User Impersonation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The MultiManager WP – Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version 1.1.2.
