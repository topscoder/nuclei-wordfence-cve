    The7 — Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress <= 11.13.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via url Attribute
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The The7 — Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'url' attribute within the plugin's Icon and Heading widgets in all versions up to, and including, 11.13.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
