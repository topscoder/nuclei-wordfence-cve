    The Ultimate Video Player For WordPress <= 2.2.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The The Ultimate Video Player For WordPress – by Presto Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to missing authorization on a REST API endpoint and  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the settinfs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
