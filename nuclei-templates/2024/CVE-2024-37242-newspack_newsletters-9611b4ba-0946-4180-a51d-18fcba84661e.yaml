  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Newspack Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.13.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
