    Innovs HR – Complete Human Resource Management System for Your Business <= 1.0.3.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Innovs HR – Complete Human Resource Management System for Your Business plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the innovs_hrm_ajax_request AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as adding themselves as an employee via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
