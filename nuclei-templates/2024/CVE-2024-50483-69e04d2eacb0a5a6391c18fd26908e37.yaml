    Meetup <= 0.1 - Authentication Bypass via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Meetup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them via the facebook_register() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, granted they know their email address.
