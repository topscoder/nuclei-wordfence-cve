    3D FlipBook <= 1.15.4 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scritping via Bookmark URL
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The 3D FlipBook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Bookmark URL field in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
