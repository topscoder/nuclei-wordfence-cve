    WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) <= 1.6.9 - Improper Path Validation to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Move and Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file movement and reading due to insufficient file path validation in the save_edit_profile_details() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php.
