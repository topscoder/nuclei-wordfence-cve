  name: >
    Popup Builder <= 4.3.0 - Missing Authorization in Multiple AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Popup Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on all AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform multiple unauthorized actions, such as deleting subscribers, and importing subscribers to conduct stored cross-site scripting attacks.
