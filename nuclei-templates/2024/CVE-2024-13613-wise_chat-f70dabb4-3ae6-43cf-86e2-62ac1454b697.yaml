    Wise Chat <= 3.3.3 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure Through Unprotected Directory
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Wise Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 via the 'uploads' directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads directory which can contain file attachments included in chat messages. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 3.3.3.
