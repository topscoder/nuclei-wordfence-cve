    Authorize.net Payment Gateway For WooCommerce <= 8.0 - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity to Unauthenticated Payment Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Authorize.net Payment Gateway For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying the authenticity of the request that updates a orders payment status. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update order payment statuses to paid bypassing any payment.
