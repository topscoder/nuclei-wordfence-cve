  name: >
    Cost Calculator Builder <= 3.2.12 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Content Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'embed-create-page' and 'embed-insert-pages' functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary posts and append arbitrary content to existing posts.
