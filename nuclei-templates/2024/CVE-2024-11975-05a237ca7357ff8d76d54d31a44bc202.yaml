    Reactflow Visitor Recording and Heatmaps <= 1.0.10 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Reactflow Visitor Recording and Heatmaps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation affecting the _wpnonce parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
