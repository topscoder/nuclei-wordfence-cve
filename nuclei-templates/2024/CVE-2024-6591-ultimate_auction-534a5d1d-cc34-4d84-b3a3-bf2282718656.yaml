  name: >
    Ultimate WordPress Auction Plugin <= 4.2.7 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Email Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Ultimate WordPress Auction Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized email creation and sending due to a missing capability check on the 'send_auction_email_callback' and 'resend_auction_email_callback' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to craft emails that include links and send to any email address.
