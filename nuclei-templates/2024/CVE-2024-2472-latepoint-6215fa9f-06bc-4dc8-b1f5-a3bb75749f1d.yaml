    LatePoint Plugin <= 4.9.9 - Missing Authorization and Sensitive Information Exposure via IDOR
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The LatePoint Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'start_or_use_session_for_customer' function in all versions up to and including 4.9.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view other customer's cabinets, including the ability to view PII such as email addresses and to change their LatePoint user password, which may or may not be associated with a WordPress account.
