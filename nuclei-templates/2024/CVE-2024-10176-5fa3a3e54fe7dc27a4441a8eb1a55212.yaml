    Compact WP Audio Player <= 1.9.13 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sc_embed_player Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Compact WP Audio Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 
    sc_embed_player shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
