    Easy CountDowner <= 1.0.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Easy CountDowner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
