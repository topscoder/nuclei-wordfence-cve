    WP Travel Engine <= 6.2.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpte_onboard_save_function_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to modify several settings that could have an impact such as lost revenue and page updates.
