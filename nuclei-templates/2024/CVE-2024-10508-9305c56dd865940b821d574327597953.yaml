    RegistrationMagic – User Registration Plugin with Custom Registration Forms <= 6.0.2.6 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Password Recovery
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic – User Registration Plugin with Custom Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the password reset token prior to updating a user's password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users, including administrators, and gain access to these accounts.
