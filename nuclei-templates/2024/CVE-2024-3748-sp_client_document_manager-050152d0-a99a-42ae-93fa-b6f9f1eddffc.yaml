  name: >
    SP Project & Document Manager <= 4.71 - Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.71 via the sp_cdm_link_save_embed AJAX action to missing validation on the 'user_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload files that look like they were uploaded by another user.
