    Soccer Engine – Soccer Plugin for WordPress <= 1.12 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Soccer Engine – Soccer Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.12. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when saving match and team settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings as well as teams, players, etc. via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
