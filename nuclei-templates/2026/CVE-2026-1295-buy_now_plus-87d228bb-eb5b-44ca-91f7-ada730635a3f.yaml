    Buy Now Plus <= 1.0.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode Attributes
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Buy Now Plus – Buy Now buttons for Stripe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'buynowplus' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
