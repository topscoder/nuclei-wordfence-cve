    Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery <= 1.8.36 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Comment Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the delete_comment() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.36. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary image comments. Note: comments functionality is only available in the Pro version of the plugin.
