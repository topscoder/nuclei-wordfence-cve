    Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart <= 7.0.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via ec_store_admin_access
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.7. This is due to a missing capability check in the 'save_custom_user_profile_fields' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply the 'ec_store_admin_access' parameter during a profile update and gain store manager access to the site.
