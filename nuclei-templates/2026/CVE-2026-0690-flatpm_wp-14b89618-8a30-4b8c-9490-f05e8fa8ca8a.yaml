    FlatPM – Ad Manager, AdSense and Custom Code <= 3.2.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Custom Post Meta
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The FlatPM – Ad Manager, AdSense and Custom Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'rank_math_description' custom field in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
