    SEATT: Simple Event Attendance <= 1.5.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Event Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SEATT: Simple Event Attendance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the event deletion functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary events via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
