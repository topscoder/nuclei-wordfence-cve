    Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms <= 1.4.5 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Form Data Exfiltration via CSV Export
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the CSV export functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download sensitive form submission data containing personally identifiable information (PII) by accessing the CSV export endpoint with an export key that is exposed in publicly accessible page source code. The vulnerability is created because while the shortcode properly filters displayed entries by user, the CSV export handler completely bypasses this filtering and exports all entries regardless of user permissions.
