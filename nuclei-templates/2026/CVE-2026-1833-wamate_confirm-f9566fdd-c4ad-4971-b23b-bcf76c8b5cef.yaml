info:
  name: >
    WaMate Confirm <= 2.0.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Phone Number Blocking/Unblocking
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WaMate Confirm – Order Confirmation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to block and unblock phone numbers, which should be restricted to administrators.
