    Smart Appointment & Booking <= 1.0.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via saab_save_form_data AJAX Action
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Smart Appointment & Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the saab_save_form_data AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
