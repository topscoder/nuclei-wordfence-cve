    TITLE ANIMATOR <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The TITLE ANIMATOR plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the settings page form handler in `inc/settings-page.php`. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
