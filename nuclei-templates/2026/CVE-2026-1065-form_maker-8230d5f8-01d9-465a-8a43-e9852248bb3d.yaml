    Form Maker by 10Web <= 1.15.35 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Form Maker by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.35. This is due to the plugin's default file upload allowlist including SVG files combined with weak substring-based extension validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript code that will execute when viewed by administrators or site visitors via file upload fields in forms granted they can submit forms.
