  name: >
    SearchWiz <= 1.0.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Post Title
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SearchWiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post titles in search results in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to the plugin using `esc_attr()` instead of `esc_html()` when outputting post titles in search results. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in post titles that will execute whenever a user performs a search and views the search results page.
