  name: >
    Team Section Block <= 2.0.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Social Network Link
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Team Section Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's block in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied social network link URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
