  name: >
    GetGenie – AI Content Writer with Keyword Research & SEO Tracking Tools <= 4.3.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GetGenie plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to delete a specific post. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete any post on the WordPress site, including posts authored by other users.
