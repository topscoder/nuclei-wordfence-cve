    All In One Image Viewer Block <= 1.0.2 - Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery via image-proxy Endpoint
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The All In One Image Viewer Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to missing authorization and URL validation on the image-proxy REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
