    Name Directory <= 1.32.0 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Double HTML-Entity Encoding in Submission Form
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Name Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via double HTML-entity encoding in all versions up to, and including, 1.32.0. This is due to the plugin's sanitization function calling `html_entity_decode()` before `wp_kses()`, and then calling `html_entity_decode()` again on output. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via the 'name_directory_name' and 'name_directory_description' parameters in the public submission form granted they can trick the site administrator into approving their submission or auto-publish is enabled.
