  name: >
    RegistrationMagic <= 6.0.7.4 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Settings Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 6.0.7.4. This is due to missing nonce verification and capability checks on the rm_set_otp AJAX action handler. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary plugin settings, including reCAPTCHA keys, security settings, and frontend menu titles.
