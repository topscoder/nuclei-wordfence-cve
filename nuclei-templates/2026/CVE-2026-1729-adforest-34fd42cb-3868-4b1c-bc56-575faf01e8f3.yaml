info:
  name: >
    AdForest <= 6.0.12 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.12. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them through the 'sb_login_user_with_otp_fun' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, including administrators.
