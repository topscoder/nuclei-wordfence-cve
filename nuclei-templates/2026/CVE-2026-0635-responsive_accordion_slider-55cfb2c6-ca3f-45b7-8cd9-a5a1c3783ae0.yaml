    Responsive Accordion Slider <= 1.2.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Slider Update via 'resp_accordion_silder_save_images'
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive Accordion Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'resp_accordion_silder_save_images' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify any slider's image metadata including titles, descriptions, alt text, and links.
