    SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System <= 3.4.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection via Number Field Filter
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the Number-type custom field filter in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.4. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied operand value when using the equals operator and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above (customers), to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
