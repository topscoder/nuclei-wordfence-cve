info:
  name: >
    Percent to Infograph <= 1.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode Attributes
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Percent to Infograph plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `percent_to_graph` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
