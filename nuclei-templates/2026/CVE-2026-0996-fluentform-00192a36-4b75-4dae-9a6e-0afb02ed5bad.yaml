    Fluent Forms <= 6.1.14 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via AI Form Builder Module
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Fluent Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the AI Form Builder module in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.14 due to a combination of missing authorization checks, a leaked nonce, and insufficient input sanitization. The vulnerability allows Subscriber-level users to trigger AI form generation via a protected endpoint. When prompted, AI services will typically return bare JavaScript code (without <script> tags), which bypasses the plugin's sanitization. This stored JavaScript executes whenever anyone views the generated form, making it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the context of any user accessing the form.
