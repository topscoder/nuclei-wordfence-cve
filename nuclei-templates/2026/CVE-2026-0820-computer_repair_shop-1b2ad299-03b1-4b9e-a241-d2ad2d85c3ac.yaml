    RepairBuddy <= 4.1116 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Signature Upload to Orders
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RepairBuddy – Repair Shop CRM & Booking Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference due to missing capability checks on the wc_upload_and_save_signature_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 4.1116. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary signatures to any order in the system, potentially modifying order metadata and triggering unauthorized status changes.
