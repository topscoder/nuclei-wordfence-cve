info:
  name: >
    File Manager Pro – Filester - <= 1.7.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Rename
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the fsConnector function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to rename an arbitrary file and ultimately execute arbitrary code via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
