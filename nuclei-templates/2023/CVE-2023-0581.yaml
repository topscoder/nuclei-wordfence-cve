info:
  name: >
    PrivateContent  <= 8.4.3 - Protection Mechanism Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The PrivateContent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection mechanism bypass due to the use of client side validation in versions up to, and including, 8.4.3. This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions  that may prevent a brute force attack.
