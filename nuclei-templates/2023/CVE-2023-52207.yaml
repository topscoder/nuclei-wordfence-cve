info:
  name: >
    HTML5 MP3 Player with Playlist Free <= 3.0.0 - Authenticated (Author+) PHP Object Injecton
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The HTML5 MP3 Player with Playlist Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
