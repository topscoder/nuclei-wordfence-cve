  name: >
    Affiliates Manager <= 2.9.20 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via process_bulk_action()
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.20. This is due to missing nonce validation on the process_bulk_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk modifications of commissions and clicks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
