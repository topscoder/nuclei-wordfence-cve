    Responsive Image Gallery, Gallery Album <= 2.0.3 - Missing Authorization via Multiple AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Responsive Image Gallery, Gallery Album plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX functions in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to e.g. create galleries, delete galleries, rename albums, delete albums, and more. CVE-2024-37542 may be a duplicate of this.
