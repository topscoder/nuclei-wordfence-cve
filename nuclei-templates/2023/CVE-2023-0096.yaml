info:
  name: "Happyforms <= 1.21.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Blocks"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Happyforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘className’ and 'anchor' block options in versions up to, and including, 1.21.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
