    Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce <= 3.7.7 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.7.7. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during a Stripe checkout through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as users who have orders, who are typically customers.
