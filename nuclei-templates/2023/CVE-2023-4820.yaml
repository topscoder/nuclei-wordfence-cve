  name: >
    PowerPress <= 11.0.11 - Authenticated(Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Media URL
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The PowerPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the media URL in versions up to, and including, 11.0.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This issue was partially patched in 11.0.11, and fully patched in 11.0.12.
