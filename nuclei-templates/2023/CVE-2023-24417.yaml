    Worthy – VG WORT Integration für WordPress <= 1.6.5-6497609 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Worthy – VG WORT Integration für WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5-6497609. This is due to missing nonce validation on various functions called via admin_post hooks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control many of the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
