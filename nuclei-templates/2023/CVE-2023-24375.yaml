  name: >
    WordPress Social Login and Register <=7.5.12 - Missing Authorization to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the mo_sharing_app_value function as well as others that are reachable via AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 7.5.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change plugin settings. 
    
    Additionally, some AJAX actions were missing nonce checks thus making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This enables unauthenticated attackers to invoke the corresponding functions, granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
