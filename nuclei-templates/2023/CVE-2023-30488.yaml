  name: >
    Featured Post Creative <= 1.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wpfp_update_featured_post
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Featured Post Creative plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce verification on the wpfp_update_featured_post function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change what post is featured via forged request, granted the attacker can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
