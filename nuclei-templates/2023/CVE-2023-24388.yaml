  name: >
    Booking calendar, Appointment Booking System <= 3.2.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Booking calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when creating, editing, duplicating and deleting bookings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate bookings using these actions via forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
