  name: >
    Webpushr <= 4.34.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Local File Inclusion via menu
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Webpushr plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.34.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation within the wpp_save_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to conduct local file inclusion attacks by leveraging the 'menu' parameter via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
