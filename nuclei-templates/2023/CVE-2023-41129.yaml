info:
  name: >
    Patreon WordPress <= 1.8.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Patreon WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the ~/classes/patreon_wordpress.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings among other actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
