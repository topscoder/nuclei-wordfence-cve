    Advanced Flat rate shipping Woocommerce <= 1.6.4.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via enableDisable and deletePost
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Advanced Flat rate shipping Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the enableDisable and deletePost functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable, disable, or delete posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
