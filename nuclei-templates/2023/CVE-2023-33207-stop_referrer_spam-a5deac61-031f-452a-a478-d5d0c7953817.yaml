    Stop Referrer Spam <= 1.3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via processParameters
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Stop Referrer Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to insufficient nonce validation on the processParameters function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to refresh the spam blocklist and save custom URLs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The issue was partially patched in version 1.3.0 but because nonce generation does not occur until the first time the admin page is visited, it is possible for an attacker to supply an empty nonce value which will successfully result in settings being saved if the administrator has not yet visited the plugin's admin page.
