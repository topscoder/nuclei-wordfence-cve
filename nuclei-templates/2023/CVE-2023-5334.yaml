  name: >
    WP Responsive header image slider <= 3.2.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Responsive header image slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'sp_responsiveslider' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
