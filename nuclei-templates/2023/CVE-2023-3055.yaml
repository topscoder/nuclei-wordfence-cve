    Page Builder by AZEXO <= 1.27.133 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via azh_save
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'azh_save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the post content and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
