info:
  name: >
    Instant CSS <= 1.1.4 - Missing Authorization via AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Instant CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to missing capability checks on several functions called via AJAX actions in the ~/classes/class.instantcss_ajax.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform a wide variety of actions such as retrieving css, theme, and minify data, along with updating the options for those. The unprotected AJAX actions present can be used to exploit a site via Cross-Site Scripting as well.
