  name: >
    Category Post List Widget <= 2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via get_cplw_settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Category Post List Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the get_cplw_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin's settings, including injecting XSS, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
