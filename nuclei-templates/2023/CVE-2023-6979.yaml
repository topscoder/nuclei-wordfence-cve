info:
  name: >
    Customer Reviews for WooCommerce <= 5.38.9 - Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ivole_import_upload_csv AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 5.38.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
