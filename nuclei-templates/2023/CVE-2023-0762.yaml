  name: >
    Clock In Portal <= 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery To Designation Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Clock In Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when deleting staff members' designations. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete staff member designations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
