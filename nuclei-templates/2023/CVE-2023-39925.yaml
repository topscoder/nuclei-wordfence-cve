  name: >
    Community by PeepSo <= 6.1.6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via delete
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.1.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete PeepSo posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
