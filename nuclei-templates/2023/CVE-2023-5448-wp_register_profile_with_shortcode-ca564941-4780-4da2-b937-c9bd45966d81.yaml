    WP Register Profile With Shortcode <= 3.5.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to User Password Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Register Profile With Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_password_validate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset a user's password via a forged request granted they can trick the user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
