  name: >
    Animated Number Counters <= 1.6 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Animated Number Counters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
