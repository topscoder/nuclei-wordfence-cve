  name: >
    Auto Publish for Google My Business <= 3.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Auto Publish for Google My Business plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to and including 3.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to auto-publish to google, delete transients, and update post metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
