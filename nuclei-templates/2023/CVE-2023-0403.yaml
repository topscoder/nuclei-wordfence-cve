    Social Warfare <= 4.3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete post meta information and reset network access tokens, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
