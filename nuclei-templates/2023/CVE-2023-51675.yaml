info:
  name: >
    Advanced Access Manager <= 6.9.18 - Authenticated (Author+) Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Advanced Access Manager – Restricted Content, Users & Roles, Enhanced Security and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 6.9.18. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via params->redirect parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers (author and higher) to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action such as logging in.
