  name: >
    Chankhe <= 1.0.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Chankhe theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the activate_plugin function called via the wp_ajax_chankhe_activate_plugin AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as subscribers, to activate arbitrary plugins.
