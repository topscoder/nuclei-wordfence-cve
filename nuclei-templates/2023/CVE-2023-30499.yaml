info:
  name: "FV Flowplayer Video Player <= 7.5.32.7212 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via id"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘id’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 7.5.32.7212 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
