    Direct Checkout – Quick View – Buy Now For WooCommerce <= 1.5.8 - Authenticated (Shop manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Custom CSS Code
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Direct Checkout – Quick View – Buy Now For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via custom CSS code in versions up to, and including, 1.5.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
