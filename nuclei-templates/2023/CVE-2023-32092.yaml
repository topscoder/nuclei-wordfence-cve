  name: >
    Community by PeepSo <= 6.0.9.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Field Duplication
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.0.9.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the duplicate_field() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate user fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
