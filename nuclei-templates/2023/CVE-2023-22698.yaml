  name: >
    Theme Blvd Responsive Google Maps <= 1.0.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcodes
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Theme Blvd Responsive Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
