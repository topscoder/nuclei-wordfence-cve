info:
  name: >
    Site Reviews <= 6.5.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Site Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to setting modification and information disclosure due to lack of capability checks in a variety of functions, including rollbackPluginAjax, downloadConsole, downloadSystemInfo and exportSettings in versions up to, and including, 6.5.1. These functions are also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access, and above, to tamper with the console logging level amongst other actions like rolling back the plugin's version.
