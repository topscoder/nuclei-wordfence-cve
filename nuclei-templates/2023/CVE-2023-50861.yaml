    HUSKY – Products Filter for WooCommerce (formerly WOOF) <= 1.3.4.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The HUSKY – Products Filter for WooCommerce (formerly WOOF) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the ext/stat/index.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger several actions related to connections and stats via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
