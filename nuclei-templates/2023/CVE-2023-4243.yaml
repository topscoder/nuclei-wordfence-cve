    FULL - Customer <= 2.2.3 - Authenticated(Subscriber+) Improper Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The FULL - Customer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload via the /install-plugin REST route in versions up to, and including, 2.2.3 due to improper authorization. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions and above to execute code by installing plugins from arbitrary remote locations including non-repository sources onto the site, granted they are packaged as a valid WordPress plugin.
