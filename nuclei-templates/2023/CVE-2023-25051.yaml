  name: >
    Comment Reply Notification <= 1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Comment Reply Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions including resetToDefaultOptions, options_page and functions surrounding comment replies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
