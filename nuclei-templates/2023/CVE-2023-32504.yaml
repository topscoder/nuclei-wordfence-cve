id: CVE-2023-32504

info:
  name: >
    Wise Chat <= 3.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wise Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions such as resetAnonymousCounterAction, resetSettingsAction, deleteAllUsersAndMessagesAction, deleteBanAction, addBanAction, clearChannelAction, deleteChannelAction, backupChannelAction, and more. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control the plugin's setttings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
