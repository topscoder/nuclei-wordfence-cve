  name: >
    Sunny Search <= 1.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Sunny Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the trySave() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
