  name: >
    BEAR <= 1.1.3.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Product Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The BEAR for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the woobe_bulk_delete_products function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
