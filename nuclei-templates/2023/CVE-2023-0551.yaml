info:
  name: >
    REST API TO MiniProgram <= 4.6.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Media Attachment Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the file_batch_delete_callback() function used to delete uploaded attachments in versions up to, and including, 4.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to delete arbitrary media files on a WordPress site.
