  name: >
    Smart WooCommerce Search <= 2.5.0 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Smart WooCommerce Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to missing capability checks on the duplicate() & remove() functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to duplicate and delete widgets created by the plugin.
