  name: >
    RegistrationMagic <= 5.1.9.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Form Metadata Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'remove' function inside the 'class_rm_form_controller.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove certain form metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
