  name: >
    Olive One Click Demo Import <= 1.0.9 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload in olive_one_click_demo_import_save_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Olive One Click Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the olive_one_click_demo_import_save_file function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level privileges and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
