info:
  name: >
    WP Forms Puzzle Captcha <= 4.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Forms Puzzle Captcha plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Furthermore, user input is sanitized insufficiently leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting.
