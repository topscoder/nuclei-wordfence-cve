  name: >
    Wp Ultimate Review <= 2.0.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wp Ultimate Review plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions like wur_settings_view(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions like modifying the plugin's settings, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
