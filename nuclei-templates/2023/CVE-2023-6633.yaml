    Site Notes <= 2.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Admin Note Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Site Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete admin notes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
