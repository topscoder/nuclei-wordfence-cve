  name: >
    TH Variation Swatches <= 1.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via delete_settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The TH Variation Swatches plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
