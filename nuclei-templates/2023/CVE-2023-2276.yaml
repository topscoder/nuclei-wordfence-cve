  name: >
    WCFM Membership – WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace <= 2.10.7 - Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference to Arbitrary User Password Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WCFM Membership – WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 2.10.7. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
