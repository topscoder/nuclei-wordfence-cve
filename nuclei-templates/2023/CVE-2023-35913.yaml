    OOPSpam Anti-Spam <= 1.1.44 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via empty_ham_entries and empty_spam_entries
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.44. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'empty_ham_entries' and 'empty_spam_entries' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete both spam and legitimate entries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
