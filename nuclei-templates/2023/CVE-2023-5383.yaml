  name: >
    Funnelforms Free <= 3.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Post Duplication
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the fnsf_copy_posts function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create copies of arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
