info:
  name: >
    GMAce <= 1.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Modification (Creation/Overwrite/Deletion)
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The GMAce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the gmace_manager_server function called via the wp_ajax_gmace_manager AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
