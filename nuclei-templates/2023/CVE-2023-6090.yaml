info:
  name: >
    Mollie Payments for WooCommerce <= 7.3.11 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Mollie Payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in one of its functions in all versions up to, and including, 7.3.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager access to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
