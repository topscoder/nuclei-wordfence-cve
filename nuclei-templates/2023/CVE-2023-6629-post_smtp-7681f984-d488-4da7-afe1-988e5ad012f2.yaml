    POST SMTP Mailer <= 2.8.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via msg
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The POST SMTP Mailer – Email log, Delivery Failure Notifications and Best Mail SMTP for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘msg’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-6621 appears to be a duplicate of this issue. CVE-2024-29128 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
