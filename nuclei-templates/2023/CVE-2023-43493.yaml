info:
  name: >
    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.8.21 - Authenticated(level_5+) SQL Injection via get_logs
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via multiple parameters in the 'get_logs' functionality in versions up to, and including, 2.8.21 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with user level 5 or higher (which corresponds roughly to Author-level capabilities) to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
