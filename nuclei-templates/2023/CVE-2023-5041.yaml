info:
  name: >
    Track The Click <= 0.3.11 - Authenticated (Author+) SQL Injection via 'stats' REST Endpoint
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Track The Click plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 0.3.11 due to insufficient escaping on user supplied data submitted via the 'stats' REST endpoint and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. NOTE: This issue was partially fixed in 0.3.11 and completely fixed in 0.3.12.
