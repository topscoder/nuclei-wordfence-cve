  name: >
    Form Maker by 10Web <= 1.15.19 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Form Maker by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'type_signature' case of the save_db() function in versions up to, and including, 1.5.19. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files, via the signature field, on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
