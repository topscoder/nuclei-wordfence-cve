info:
  name: >
    Novelist <= 1.2.0 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Book Information Fields
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Novelist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via certain book information fields in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
