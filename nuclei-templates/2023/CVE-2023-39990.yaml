  name: >
    Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On <= 1.2.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Course Modifications
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on the pmpro_courses_update_course_callback() and pmpro_courses_remove_course_callback() functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to update and remove courses from the course page.
