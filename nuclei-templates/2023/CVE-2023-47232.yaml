  name: >
    WP Affiliate Disclosure <= 1.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via check_capability
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Affiliate Disclosure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to incorrect nonce validation logic on the check_capability function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin options via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
