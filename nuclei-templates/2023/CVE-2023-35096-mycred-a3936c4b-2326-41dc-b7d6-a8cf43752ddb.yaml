  name: >
    myCred <= 2.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The myCred plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the mycred_save_license() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's membership key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
