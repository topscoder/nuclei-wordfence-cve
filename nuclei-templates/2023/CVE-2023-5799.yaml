info:
  name: >
    WP Hotel Booking <= 2.0.8 - Insufficient Authorization to Unauthorized Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to insufficient authorization checks on the tp_extra_package_remove() function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts. While the patch for CVE-2023-5651 ensured subscriber-level users couldn't delete arbitrary posts, the checks were not sufficient in preventing higher authenticated users such as contributors from deleting arbitrary posts.
