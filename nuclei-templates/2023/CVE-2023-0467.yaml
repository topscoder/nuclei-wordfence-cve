info:
  name: >
    WP Dark Mode <= 4.0.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Local File Inclusion via 'style'
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Dark Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 4.0.7 via the 'style' shortcode attribute. This allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. This only affects installations where the traversal of non-existent directories is allowed or when chained with another vulnerability that allows for the creation of arbitrary directories.
