info:
  name: >
    Essential Blocks for Gutenberg <= 4.2.0 - Missing Authorization via AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Essential Blocks for Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access to AJAX actions due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 4.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to invoke those functions. A nonce check was performed in all of them. However, the nonce was leaked on the profile page.
