  name: >
    WP Job Manager <= 2.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
