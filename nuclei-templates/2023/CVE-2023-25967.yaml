  name: >
    Community by PeepSo <= 6.0.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Plugin/Subscription Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.0.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'peepso.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to unsubscribe email subscribers or delete the peepso plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
