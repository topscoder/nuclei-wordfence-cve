  name: >
    Real Estate Directory <= 1.0.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via rdm_activate_plugin
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Real Estate Directory theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rdm_activate_plugin function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
