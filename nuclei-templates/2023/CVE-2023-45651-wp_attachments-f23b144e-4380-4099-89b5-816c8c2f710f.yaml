info:
  name: >
    WP Attachments <= 5.0.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpatt_plugin_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
