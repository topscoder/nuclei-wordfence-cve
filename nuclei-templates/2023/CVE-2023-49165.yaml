  name: >
    Client Dash <= 2.2.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Client Dash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. Note that this may be a duplicate of CVE-2019-17071
