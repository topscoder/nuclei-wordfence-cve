info:
  name: >
    Quick Event Manager <= 9.7.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Quick Event Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 9.7.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on several calls in the qem_messages() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manage and alter registration settings that should be intended only for site administrators via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
