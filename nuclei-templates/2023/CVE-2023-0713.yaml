info:
  name: >
    Wicked Folders <= 2.18.16 - Missing Authorization on ajax_add_folder
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the ajax_add_folder function in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke this function and perform actions intended for administrators such as modifying the folder structure maintained by the plugin.
