    ChatBot 4.8.6 - 4.9.6 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in FAQ Builder
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the FAQ Builder in versions 4.8.6 through 4.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. NOTE: This vulnerability is a re-introduction of CVE-2023-4253.
