info:
  name: >
    Ultimate Member <= 2.6.6 - Privilege Escalation via Arbitrary User Meta Updates
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to the plugin using a predefined list of user meta keys that are banned which can be bypassed via a few method like adding slashes to the user meta key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on a site as an administrator.
