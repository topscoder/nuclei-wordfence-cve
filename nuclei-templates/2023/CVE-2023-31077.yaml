  name: >
    Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS <= 2.1.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via Multiple AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions, such as triggering an HTML export, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
