  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Form Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the get_requests() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms on behalf of another user via a forged request granted they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
