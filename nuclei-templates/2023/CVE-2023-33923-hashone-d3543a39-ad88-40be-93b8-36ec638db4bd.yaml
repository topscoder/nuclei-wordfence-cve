    Multiple Themes (Various Versions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Several themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the activate_plugin() function called via an AJAX action in various versions of the themes. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request, if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
