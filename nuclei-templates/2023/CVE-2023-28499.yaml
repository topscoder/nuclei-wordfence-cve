info:
  name: >
    Slide Anything <= 2.4.7 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Slide Anything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with author-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
