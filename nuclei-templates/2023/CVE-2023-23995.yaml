  name: >
    TinyMCE Custom Styles <= 1.1.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The TinyMCE Custom Styles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. The issue was partially patched in 1.1.3 and fully patched in 1.1.4.
