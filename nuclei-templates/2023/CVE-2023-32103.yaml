  name: >
    TP Education <= 4.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcodes
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The TP Education plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
