  name: >
    Posts Like Dislike <= 1.1.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Plugin Setting Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Posts Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to reset the plugin's settings. Note: this issue was only partially patched in 1.1.1 as the nonce is still visible to subscriber-level users.
