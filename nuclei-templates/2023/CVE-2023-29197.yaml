    guzzlehttp/psr7 < 1.9.1 & 2.4.5 - Interpretation Conflict
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in PHP. Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. 
    
    While some WordPress plugins and themes may be using this library, it does not make them vulnerable to exploitation.
