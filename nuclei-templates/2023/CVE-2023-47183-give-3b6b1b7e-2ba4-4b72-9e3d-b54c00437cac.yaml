  name: >
    GiveWP <= 2.33.1 - Missing Authorization via handleBeforeGateway
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The GiveWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized donation form access due to a missing check on the handleBeforeGateway function that would ensure that a donation form can be used and is not trashed in versions up to, and including, 2.33.1. There is no real security impact, but such trashed donation forms could still receive donations in vulnerable versions.
