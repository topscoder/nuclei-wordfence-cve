    NEX-Forms - Ultimate Form Builder <= 8.4.3 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Form Name
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The NEX-Forms - Ultimate Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form names parameter in versions up to, and including, 8.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The plugin has the option to allow lower-level users access to the form, which may make this issue exploitable by lower-privileged users in some instances.
