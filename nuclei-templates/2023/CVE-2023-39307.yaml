  name: >
    Avada <= 7.11.1 - Authenticated(Contributor+) Arbitrary File Upload via 'ajax_import_options'
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'ajax_import_options' function in versions up to, and including, 7.11.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor permissions to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible if they are able to successfully exploit a race condition.
