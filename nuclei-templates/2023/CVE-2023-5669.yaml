  name: >
    Featured Image Caption <= 0.8.10 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Featured Image Caption plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode and post meta in all versions up to, and including, 0.8.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
