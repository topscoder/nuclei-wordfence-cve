info:
  name: >
    PHP to Page <= 0.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The PHP to Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 0.3 via the 'php-to-page' shortcode. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above, to include local file and potentially execute code on the server. While subscribers may need to poison log files or otherwise get a file installed in order to achieve remote code execution, author and above users can upload files by default and achieve remote code execution easily.
