    WP Full Stripe Free <= 7.0.17 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Full Stripe Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.0.17. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation via several functions in the ~/include/wp-full-stripe-admin-menu.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
