info:
  name: >
    ND Shortcodes <= 6.9 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ND Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 6.9 the plugin's shortcodes. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions, and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
