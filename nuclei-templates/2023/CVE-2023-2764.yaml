  name: >
    Draw Attention <= 2.0.11 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Post Featured Image Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Draw Attention plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_set_featured_image function in versions up to, and including, 2.0.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change the featured image of arbitrary posts with an image that exists in the media library.
