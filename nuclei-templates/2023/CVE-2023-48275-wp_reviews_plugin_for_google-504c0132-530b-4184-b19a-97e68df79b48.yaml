  name: >
    Multiple Plugins by Trustindex.io <= (Various Versions)- Authenticated (Editor+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Multiple plugins for WordPress by Trustindex.io are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/tabs/feature_request.php file in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This vulnerability may only be fully exploitable for RCE in unique scenarios where the server is overloaded and the unlink() is not triggered immediately following move_uploaded_file().
