    phpinfo() WP <= 4.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The phpinfo() WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the new_request() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an .htaccess backup along with restoring and editing an .htaccess file, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
