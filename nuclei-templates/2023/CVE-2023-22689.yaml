    Auto Affiliate Links <= 6.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via aalDeleteLink function
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Auto Affiliate Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the aalDeleteLink() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete links via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
