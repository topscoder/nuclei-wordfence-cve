  name: >
    Multi Rating <= 5.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Ratings Value Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Multi Rating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the mr_edit_rating function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary ratings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
