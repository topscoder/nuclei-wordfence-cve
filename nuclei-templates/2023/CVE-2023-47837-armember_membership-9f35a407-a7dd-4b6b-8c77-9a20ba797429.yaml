  name: >
    ARMember <= 4.0.10 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Membership Plan Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ARMember – Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to membership plan bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.10. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to membership levels. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above to bypass membership plans.
