    WordPress Job Board and Recruitment Plugin – JobWP <= 2.0 - Arbitrary File Upload via 'jobwp_upload_resume'
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WordPress Job Board and Recruitment Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'jobwp_upload_resume' function in versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
