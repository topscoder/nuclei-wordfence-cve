    Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita <= 4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Account Logout
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the vcita_logout_callback function in versions up to, and including, 4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated to logout a vctia connected account which would cause a denial of service on the appointment scheduler, via a forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
