  name: >
    Responsive Column Widgets <= 1.2.7 - Open Redirect via responsive_column_widgets_link
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Responsive Column Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via the responsive_column_widgets_link parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
