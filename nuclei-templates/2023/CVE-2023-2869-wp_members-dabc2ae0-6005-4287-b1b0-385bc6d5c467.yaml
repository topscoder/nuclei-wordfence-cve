  name: >
    WP-Members Membership <= 3.4.7.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP-Members Membership for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4.7.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the do_field_reorder function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reorder form elements via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
