info:
  name: >
    PHP Execution <= 1.0.0 - Cross Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The PHP Execution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/php_execution_admin.php function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable the ability for users with low-level privileged users to trigger PHP,  via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
