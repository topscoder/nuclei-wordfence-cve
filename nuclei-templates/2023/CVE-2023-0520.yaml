info:
  name: >
    RapidExpCart <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The RapidExpCart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the config function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally, as these settings are not sanitized on input or escaped on output, it is possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute when this vulnerability is exploited.
