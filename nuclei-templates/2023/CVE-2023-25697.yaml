  name: >
    GamiPress <= 2.5.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to User Earnings Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The GamiPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bulk_delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link and results in the bulk deletion of user earnings.
