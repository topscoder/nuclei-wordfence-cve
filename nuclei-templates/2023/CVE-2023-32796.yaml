info:
  name: >
    WooCommerce Product Enquiry <= 2.3.4 - Unauthenticated Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Product Enquiry plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Self-Cross-Site Scripting via the enquiry form fields in versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in the page an enquiry form is on, though it would require successful social engineering to get the user to input the malicious payload into form fields.
