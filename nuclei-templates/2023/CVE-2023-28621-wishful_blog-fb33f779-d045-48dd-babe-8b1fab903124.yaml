    Wishful Blog <= 2.0.1 & Raise Mag <= 1.0.7 - Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Wishful Blog theme, versions up to and including 2.0.1, and Raise Mag theme, versions up to and including 1.0.7, for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
