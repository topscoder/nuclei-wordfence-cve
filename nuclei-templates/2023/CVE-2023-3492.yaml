    WP Shopping Pages <= 1.14 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Shopping Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add malicious JavaScript payloads to the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
