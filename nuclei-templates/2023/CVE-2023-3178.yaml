  name: >
    POST SMTP Mailer <= 2.5.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Log Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The POST SMTP Mailer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to incorrect nonce validation on the delete_logs_ajax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete logs granted they can trick a site user with the manage_postman_smtp capability into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
