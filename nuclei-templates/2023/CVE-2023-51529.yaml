  name: >
    HT Mega <= 2.3.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via Several Functions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The HT Mega plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the /admin/include/template-library.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
