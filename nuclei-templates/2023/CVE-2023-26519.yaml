info:
  name: >
    Publish to Schedule <= 4.5.4 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Publish to Schedule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.5.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
