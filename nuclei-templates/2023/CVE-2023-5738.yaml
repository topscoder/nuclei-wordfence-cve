info:
  name: >
    WordPress Backup & Migration <= 1.4.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.4.4, but still allowed exploitation by authenticated attackers with administrator-level permissions.
