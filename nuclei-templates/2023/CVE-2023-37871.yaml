  name: >
    WooCommerce GoCardless Gateway <= 2.5.6 - Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce GoCardless Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action that may affect the integrity or confidentially of data that should be outside of the user's control.
