  name: >
    Backup Migration <= 1.3.6 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download to Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to insufficient path and file validation on the BMI_BACKUP case of the handle_downloading function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download back-up files which can contain sensitive information such as user passwords, PII,  database credentials, and much more.
