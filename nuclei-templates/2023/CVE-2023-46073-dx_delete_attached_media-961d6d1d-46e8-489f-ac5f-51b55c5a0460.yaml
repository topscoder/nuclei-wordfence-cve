    DX Delete Attached Media <= 2.0.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via add_to_base
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The DX Delete Attached Media plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the add_to_base function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
