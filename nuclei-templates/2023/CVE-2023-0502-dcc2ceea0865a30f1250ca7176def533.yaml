    WP News <= 1.1.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP News plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'plugin_activation' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
