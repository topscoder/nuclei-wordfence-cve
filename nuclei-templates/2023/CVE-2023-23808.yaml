info:
  name: >
    Sponsors Carousel <= 4.02 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in show
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Sponsors Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the an image title in versions up to, and including, 4.02 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the show function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level privileges, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
