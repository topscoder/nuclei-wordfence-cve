  name: >
    Ninja Forms <= 3.6.25 - Denial of Service via Large Form Submissions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to denial of service in versions up to, and including, 3.6.25. This is due to insufficient controls on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to craft form submissions with excessive extra data that may exceed the capacity of the database and prevent further requests from being successful while the submission is processing.
