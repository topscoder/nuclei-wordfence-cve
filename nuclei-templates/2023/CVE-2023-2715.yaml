info:
  name: >
    Groundhogg <= 2.7.9.8 - Missing Authorization to Admin Account and Ticket Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'submit_ticket' function in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to create a support ticket that sends the website's data to the plugin developer, and it is also possible to create an admin access with an auto login link that is also sent to the plugin developer with the ticket. It only works if the plugin is activated with a valid license.
