info:
  name: >
    Shared Files <= 1.7.5 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Shared Files – Advanced File Sharing & Download Manager with Frontend Uploads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via uploaded file content in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 due to the plugin not returning the correct 'Content-Type' header when viewing uploaded files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in uploaded files that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected upload.
