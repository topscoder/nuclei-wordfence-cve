info:
  name: >
    User Activity Log <= 1.6.5 - Unauthenticated Data Export to Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The User Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 via the ual_export_log() function that is missing a capability check. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including user roles, usernames, and IP Addresses. This issue was partially patched in 1.6.4, which made it only exploitable by authenticated users, and a full patch was released in 1.6.6.
