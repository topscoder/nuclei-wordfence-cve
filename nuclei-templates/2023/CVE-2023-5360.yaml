  name: >
    Royal Elementor Addons and Templates <= 1.3.78 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.78. This is due to insufficient file type validation in the handle_file_upload() function called via AJAX which allows attackers to supply a preferred filetype extension to the 'allowed_file_types' parameter, with a special character, which makes it possible for the uploaded file to bypass their filter list. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
