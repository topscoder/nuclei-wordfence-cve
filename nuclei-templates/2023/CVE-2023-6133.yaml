info:
  name: >
    Forminator <= 1.27.0 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Forminator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient blacklisting on the 'forminator_allowed_mime_types' function in versions up to, and including, 1.27.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, but due to the htaccess configuration, remote code cannot be executed.
