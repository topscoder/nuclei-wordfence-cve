info:
  name: >
    Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload - Contact Form 7 <= 1.3.7.3 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload - Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads to insufficient file type validation in the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can be exploited if a user authorized to edit form, which means editor privileges or above, has added a 'multiple file upload' form field with '*' acceptable file types.
