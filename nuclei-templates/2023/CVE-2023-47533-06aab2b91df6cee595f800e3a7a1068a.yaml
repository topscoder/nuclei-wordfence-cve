    Countdown and CountUp, WooCommerce Sales Timer <= 1.8.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Countdown and CountUp, WooCommerce Sales Timer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
