  name: >
    FV Flowplayer Video Player <= 7.5.30.7210 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.5.30.7210. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_toggle() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
