info:
  name: >
    Easy WP Cleaner <= 1.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Easy WP Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the easy_wp_cleaner_optimize() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete data from a WordPress instance via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
