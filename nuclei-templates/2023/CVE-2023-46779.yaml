info:
  name: >
    EasyRecipe <= 3.5.3251 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The EasyRecipe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.3251. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions such as the saveStyle() and updateCustomCSS() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several of the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
