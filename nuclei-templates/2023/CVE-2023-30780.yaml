info:
  name: >
    User IP and Location <= 2.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The User IP and Location plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
