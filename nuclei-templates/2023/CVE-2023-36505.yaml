info:
  name: >
    Ninja Forms <= 3.6.24 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletions in versions up to, and including, 3.6.24. This is due to insufficient restriction on the file path that can be supplied during file deletion. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level access, to delete arbitrary files on the server. One such file that could be targeted is wp-config.php which if deleted can make it possible for an attacker to connect a site to their own database and ultimately achieve remote code execution on the server.
