  name: >
    Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form <= 2.1.0 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the rednao_smart_forms_save_form_values function in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit forms, including entering stored cross-site scripting, as output is not properly escaped.
