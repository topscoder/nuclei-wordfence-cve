    Lucky Draw Contests <= 4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Lucky Draw Contests plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in misc-settings.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
