    Shortcodes Ultimate <= 7.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the preview function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    In combination with CVE-2025-7354, it leads to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.
