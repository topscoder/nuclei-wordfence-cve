  name: >
    Peer Publish <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Peer Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the website management pages. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, modify, or delete website configurations via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
