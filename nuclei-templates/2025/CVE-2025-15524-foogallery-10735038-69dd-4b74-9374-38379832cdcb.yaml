  name: >
    Gallery by FooGallery <= 3.1.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Gallery Metadata Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gallery by FooGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_get_gallery_info() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve metadata (name, image count, thumbnail URL) of private, draft, and password-protected galleries by enumerating gallery IDs.
