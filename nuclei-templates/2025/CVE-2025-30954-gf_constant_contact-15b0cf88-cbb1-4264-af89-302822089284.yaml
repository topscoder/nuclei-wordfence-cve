    WP Gravity Forms Constant Contact Plugin <= 1.1.0 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Gravity Forms Constant Contact Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
