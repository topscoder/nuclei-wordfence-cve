    SocialChamp with WordPress <= 1.3.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SocialChamp with WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpsc_settings_tab_menu function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
