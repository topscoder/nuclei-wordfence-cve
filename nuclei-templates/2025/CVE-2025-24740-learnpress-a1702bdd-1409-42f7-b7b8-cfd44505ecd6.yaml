    LearnPress <= 4.2.7.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7.1. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
