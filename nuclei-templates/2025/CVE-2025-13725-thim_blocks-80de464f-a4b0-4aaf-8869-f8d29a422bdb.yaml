    Gutenberg Thim Blocks <= 1.0.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Read via 'iconSVG' Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gutenberg Thim Blocks – Page Builder, Gutenberg Blocks for the Block Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file reads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to insufficient path validation in the server-side rendering of the thim-blocks/icon block. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server via the 'iconSVG' parameter, which can contain sensitive information such as wp-config.php.
