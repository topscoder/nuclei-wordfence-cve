  name: >
    GeoDirectory – WP Business Directory Plugin and Classified Listings Directory <= 2.8.139 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary Image Attachment
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GeoDirectory – WP Business Directory Plugin and Classified Listings Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.139 via the 'post_attachment_upload' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to attach arbitrary image files to arbitrary places.
