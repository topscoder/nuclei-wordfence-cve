    Ultimate Member <= 2.11.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Profile Privacy Setting Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Profile Privacy Setting Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0. This is due to a flaw in the secure fields mechanism where field keys are stored in the allowed fields list before the `required_perm` check is applied during rendering. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access to modify their profile privacy settings (e.g., setting profile to "Only me") via direct parameter manipulation, even when the administrator has explicitly disabled the option for their role.
