    Mamurjor Employee Info <= 1.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Employee and Related Data Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Mamurjor Employee Info plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple administrative functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, update, or delete employee records, departments, designations, salary grades, education records, and salary payments via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
