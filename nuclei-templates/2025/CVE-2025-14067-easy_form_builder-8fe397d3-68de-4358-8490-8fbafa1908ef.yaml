  name: >
    Easy Form Builder <= 3.9.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Form Response Data Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Easy Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive form response data, including messages, admin replies, and user information due to a logic error in the authorization check that uses AND (&&) instead of OR (||).
