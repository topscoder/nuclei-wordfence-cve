  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) – Easy Quiz and Survey Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability and status checks on multiple functions in all versions up to, and including, 10.3.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view the details of unpublished, private, or password-protected quizzes, as well as submit file responses to questions from those quizzes, which allow file upload.
