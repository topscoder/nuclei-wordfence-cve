    Nokri - Job Board WordPress Theme <= 1.6.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Nokri - Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
