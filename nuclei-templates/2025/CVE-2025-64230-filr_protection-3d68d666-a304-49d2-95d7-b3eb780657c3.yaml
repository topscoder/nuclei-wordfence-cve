  name: >
    Filr <= 1.2.10 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Filr – Secure document library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
