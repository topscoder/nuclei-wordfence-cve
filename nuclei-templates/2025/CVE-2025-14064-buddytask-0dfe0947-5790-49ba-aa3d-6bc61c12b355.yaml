    BuddyTask <= 1.3.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Cross-Group Task Board Access and Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BuddyTask plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX endpoints in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to view, create, modify, and delete task boards belonging to any BuddyPress group, including private and hidden groups they are not members of.
