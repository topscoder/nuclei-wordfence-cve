info:
  name: >
    WP Duplicate Page <= 1.7 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Duplicate Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'saveSettings' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify plugin settings that control role capabilities, and subsequently exploit the misconfigured capabilities to duplicate and view password-protected posts containing sensitive information.
