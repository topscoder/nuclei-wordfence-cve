  name: >
    Stopwords for comments <= 1.1 - Missing Authorization to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Stopwords for comments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'set_stopwords_for_comments' and 'delete_stopwords_for_comments' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or delete stopwords via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
