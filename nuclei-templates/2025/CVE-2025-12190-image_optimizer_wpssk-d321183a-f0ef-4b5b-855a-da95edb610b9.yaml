    Image Optimizer by wps.sk <= 1.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Bulk Image Optimization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Image Optimizer by wps.sk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the imagopby_ajax_optimize_gallery() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger bulk optimization via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
