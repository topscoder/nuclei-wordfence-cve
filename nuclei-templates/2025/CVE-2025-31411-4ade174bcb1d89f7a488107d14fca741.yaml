    Linet ERP-Woocommerce Integration <= 3.5.12 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Read & Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Linet ERP-Woocommerce Integration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). Attackers can leverage the same functionality to read arbitrary files on the server.
