  name: >
    xShare <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to 'rs_plugin_reset' Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The xShare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'xshare_plugin_reset()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
