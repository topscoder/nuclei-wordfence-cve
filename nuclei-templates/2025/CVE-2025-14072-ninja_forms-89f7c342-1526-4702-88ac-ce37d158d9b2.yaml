    Ninja Forms <= 3.13.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Submission Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms – The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the /ninja-forms-views/token/refresh function in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate a token and view arbitrary form submissions.
