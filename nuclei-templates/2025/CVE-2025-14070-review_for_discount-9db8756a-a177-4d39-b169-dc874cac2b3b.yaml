  name: >
    Reviewify <= 1.0.6 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary WooCommerce Coupon Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Reviewify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'send_test_email' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to create arbitrary WooCommerce discount coupons, potentially causing financial loss to the store.
