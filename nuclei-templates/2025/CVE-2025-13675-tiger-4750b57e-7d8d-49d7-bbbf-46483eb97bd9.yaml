  name: >
    Tiger <= 101.2.1 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Tiger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 101.2.1. This is due to the 'paypal-submit.php' file not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site.
