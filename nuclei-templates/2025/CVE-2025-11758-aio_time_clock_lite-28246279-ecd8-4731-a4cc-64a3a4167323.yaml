    All in One Time Clock Lite – Tracking Employee Time Has Never Been Easier <= 2.0.3 - Missing Authorization to Page Creation and Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The All in One Time Clock Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing authorization check in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is due  to the plugin exposing admin-level AJAX actions to unauthenticated users via wp_ajax_nopriv_ hooks, while relying only on a nonce check without capability checks. This makes it possible for  unauthenticated attackers to create published pages, create shift records with integrity issues, and download time reports containing PII (employee names and work schedules).
