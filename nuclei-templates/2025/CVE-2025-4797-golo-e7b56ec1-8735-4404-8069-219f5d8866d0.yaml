info:
  name: >
    Golo <= 1.7.0 - Authentication Bypass to Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Golo - City Travel Guide WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to setting an authorization cookie. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, provided they know the user's email address. CVE-2025-54725 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
