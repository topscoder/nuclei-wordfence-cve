info:
  name: >
    My Album Gallery <= 1.0.4 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Image Title
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The My Album Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via image titles in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'attachment->title' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
