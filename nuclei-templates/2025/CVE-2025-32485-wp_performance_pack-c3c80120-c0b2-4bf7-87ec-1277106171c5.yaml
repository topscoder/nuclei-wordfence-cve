  description: >
    The WP Performance Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
