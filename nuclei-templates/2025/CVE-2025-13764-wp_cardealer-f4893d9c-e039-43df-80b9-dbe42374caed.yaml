  name: >
    WP CarDealer <= 1.2.16 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP CarDealer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.16. This is due to the 'WP_CarDealer_User::process_register' function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site.
