    Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution <= 3.9.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Course Enrollment Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized course enrollment in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.3. This is due to a missing capability check and purchasability validation in the `course_enrollment()` AJAX handler. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to enroll themselves in any course without going through the proper purchase flow.
