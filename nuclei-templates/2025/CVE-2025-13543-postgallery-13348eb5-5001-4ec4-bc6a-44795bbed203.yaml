  name: >
    PostGallery <= 1.12.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The PostGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the 'PostGalleryUploader' class functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
