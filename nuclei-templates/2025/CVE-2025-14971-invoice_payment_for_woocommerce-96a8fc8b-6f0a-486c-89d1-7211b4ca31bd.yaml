    Link Invoice Payment for WooCommerce <= 2.8.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Partial Payment Creation/Cancellation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Link Invoice Payment for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the createPartialPayment and cancelPartialPayment functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create partial payments on any order or cancel any existing partial payment via ID enumeration.
