    Demo Importer Plus <= 2.0.8 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Site Reset and Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Demo Importer Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data, loss of data, and privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the Ajax::handle_request() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to trigger a full site reset, dropping all database tables except users/usermeta and re-running wp_install(), which also assigns the Administrator role to the attacking subscriber account.
