    Schedule Post Changes With PublishPress Future: Unpublish, Delete, Change Status, Trash, Change Categories <= 4.9.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Workflow Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Schedule Post Changes With PublishPress Future plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.3. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to create, update, delete, and publish malicious workflows that may automatically delete any post upon publication or update, including posts created by administrators.
