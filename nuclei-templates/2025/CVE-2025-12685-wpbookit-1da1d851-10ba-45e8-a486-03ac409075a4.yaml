  name: >
    WPBookit <= 1.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Customer Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'delete_customer' route. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete customers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
