    WP DB Booster <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Database Cleanup
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP DB Booster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the cleanup_all AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete database records including post drafts, revisions, comments, and metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
