    Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! <= 7.2.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Location Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'location_delete' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete locations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
