    Advanced Custom Fields: Extended <= 0.9.2.1 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Insert User Form Action
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Advanced Custom Fields: Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.2.1. This is due to the 'insert_user' function not restricting the roles with which a user can register. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited if 'role' is mapped to the custom field.
