  name: >
    Automation By Autonami <= 3.5.1 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The FunnelKit Automations – Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
