    Homey - Booking and Rentals WordPress Theme <= 2.4.4 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary User Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.4 via the 'homey_delete_user_account' action due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete other user's accounts.
