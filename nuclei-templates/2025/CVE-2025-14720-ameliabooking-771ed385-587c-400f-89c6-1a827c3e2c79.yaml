    Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia <= 1.2.38 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Multiple AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.38. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark payments as refunded, trigger sending of queued notifications (emails/SMS/WhatsApp), and access debug information among other things.
