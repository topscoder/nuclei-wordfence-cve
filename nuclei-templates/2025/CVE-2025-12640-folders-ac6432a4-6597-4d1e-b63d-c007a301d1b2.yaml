    Folders – Unlimited Folders to Organize Media Library Folder, Pages, Posts, File Manager <= 3.1.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) Media Replacement
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Folders – Unlimited Folders to Organize Media Library Folder, Pages, Posts, File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Arbitrary Media Replacement in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5. This is due to missing object-level authorization checks in the handle_folders_file_upload() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to replace arbitrary media files from the WordPress Media Library.
