info:
  name: >
    Reveal Listing <= 3.3 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Reveal Listing plugin by smartdatasoft for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role or by supplying 'listing_user_role' field. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the administrator role.
