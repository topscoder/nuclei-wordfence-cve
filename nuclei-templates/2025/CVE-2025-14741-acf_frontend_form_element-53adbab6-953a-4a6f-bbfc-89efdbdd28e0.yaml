    Frontend Admin by DynamiApps <= 3.28.25 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Data Deletion via 'delete post' Form Element
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization to unauthorized data modification and deletion due to a missing capability check on the 'delete_object' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.25. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts, pages, products, taxonomy terms, and user accounts.
