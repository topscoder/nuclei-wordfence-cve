info:
  name: >
    Kunze Law <= 2.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Kunze Law plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin's shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to the plugin fetching HTML content from a remote server and injecting it into pages without any sanitization or escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
    Additional presence of a path traversal vulnerability in the shortcode name allows writing malicious HTML files to arbitrary writable locations on the server.
