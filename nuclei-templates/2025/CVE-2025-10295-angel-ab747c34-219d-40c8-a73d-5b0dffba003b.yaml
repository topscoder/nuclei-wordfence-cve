  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Angel – Fashion Model Agency WordPress CMS Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting the profile media uploader in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires the user has access to the edit profile form with the media upload option.
