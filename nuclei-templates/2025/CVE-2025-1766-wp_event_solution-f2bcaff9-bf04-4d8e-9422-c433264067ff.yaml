    Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin <= 4.0.24 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Payment Status Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'payment_complete' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.24. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the status of ticket payments to 'completed', possibly resulting in financial loss.
