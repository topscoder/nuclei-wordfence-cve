    Time Sheets <= 2.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Time Sheets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several endpoints. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
