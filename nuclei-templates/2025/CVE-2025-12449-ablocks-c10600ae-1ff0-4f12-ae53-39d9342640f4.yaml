    aBlocks – WordPress Gutenberg Blocks <= 2.4.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Settings Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The aBlocks – WordPress Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and disclosure of sensitive information due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to read plugin settings including block visibility, maintenance mode configuration, and third-party email marketing API keys, as well as read sensitive configuration data including API keys for email marketing services.
