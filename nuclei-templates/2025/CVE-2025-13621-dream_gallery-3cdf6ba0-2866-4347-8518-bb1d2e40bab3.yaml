    dream gallery <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'dreampluginsmain' AJAX Action
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The dream gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'dreampluginsmain' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
