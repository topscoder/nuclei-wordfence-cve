  name: >
    WPFunnels <= 3.5.26 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPFunnels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.5.26 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
