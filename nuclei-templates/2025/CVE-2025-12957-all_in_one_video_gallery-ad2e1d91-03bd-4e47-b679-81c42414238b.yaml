  name: >
    All-in-One Video Gallery <= 4.5.7 - Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary File Upload via VTT Upload Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.7. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting VTT files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid VTT file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
