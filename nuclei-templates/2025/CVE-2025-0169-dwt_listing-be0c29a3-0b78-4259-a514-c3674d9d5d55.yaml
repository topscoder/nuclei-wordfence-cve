    DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme <=3.3.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
