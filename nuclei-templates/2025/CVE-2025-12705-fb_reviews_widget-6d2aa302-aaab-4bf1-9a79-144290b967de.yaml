  name: >
    Social Reviews & Recommendations <= 2.5 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Social Media Reviews
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Social Reviews & Recommendations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in the 'trim_text' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.5.
