    WoodMart <= 8.2.5 - Unauthenticated Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WoodMart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.5 via the woodmart_get_posts_by_query() function due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
