  name: >
    DebateMaster <= 1.0.0 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Color Options via 'debate' Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The DebateMaster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the color options in the plugin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a page with the debate shortcode. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
