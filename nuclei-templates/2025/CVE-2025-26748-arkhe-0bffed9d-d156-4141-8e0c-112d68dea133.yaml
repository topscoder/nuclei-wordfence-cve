    Arkhe <= 3.11.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Arkhe theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.11.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute code in files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
