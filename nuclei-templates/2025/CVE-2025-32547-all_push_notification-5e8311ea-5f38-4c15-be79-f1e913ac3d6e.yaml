    All push notification for WP <= 1.5.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All push notification for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
