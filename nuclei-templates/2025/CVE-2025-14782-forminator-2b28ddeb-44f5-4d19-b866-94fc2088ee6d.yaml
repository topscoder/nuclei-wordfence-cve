  name: >
    Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder <= 1.49.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Forminator User+) CSV Export
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.49.1 via the 'listen_for_csv_export' function. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Forminator dashboard, to export sensitive form submission data including personally identifiable information.
