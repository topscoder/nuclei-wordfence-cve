  author: topscoder

  description: >
    The MD Custom content after or before of post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
