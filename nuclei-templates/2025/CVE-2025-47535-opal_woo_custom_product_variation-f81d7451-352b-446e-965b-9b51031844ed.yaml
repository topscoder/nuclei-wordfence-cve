  name: >
    Opal Woo Custom Product Variation <= 1.2.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Opal Woo Custom Product Variation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the owcpv_delete_fineuploader() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
