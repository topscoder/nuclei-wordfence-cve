    Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 <= 1.3.9.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing ownership check in the dnd_codedropz_upload_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary uploaded files when the "Send attachments as links" setting is enabled.
