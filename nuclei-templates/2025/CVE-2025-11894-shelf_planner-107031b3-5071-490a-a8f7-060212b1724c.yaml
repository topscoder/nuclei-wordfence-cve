    Shelf Planner <= 2.7.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Shelf Planner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several REST API endpoints in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several of the plugin's settings like the ServerKey and LicenseKey.
