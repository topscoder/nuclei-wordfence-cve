  name: >
    Campay Woocommerce Payment Gateway <= 1.2.2 - Unauthenticated Payment Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Campay Woocommerce Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Payment Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating that a transaction has occurred through the payment gateway. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass payments and mark orders as successfully completed resulting in a loss of income.
