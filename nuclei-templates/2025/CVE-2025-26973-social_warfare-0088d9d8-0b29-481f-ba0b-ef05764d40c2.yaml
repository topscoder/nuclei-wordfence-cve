    Social Sharing Plugin – Social Warfare <= 4.5.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Social Sharing Plugin – Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
