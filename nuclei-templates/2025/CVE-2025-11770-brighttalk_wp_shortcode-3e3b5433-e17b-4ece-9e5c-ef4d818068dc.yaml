    BrightTALK WordPress Shortcode <= 2.4.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BrightTALK WordPress Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'format' shortcode attribute in the brighttalk-time shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
