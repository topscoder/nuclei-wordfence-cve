    NEX-Forms – Ultimate Forms Plugin for WordPress <= 9.1.8 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The NEX-Forms – Ultimate Forms Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the NF5_Export_Forms class constructor in all versions up to, and including, 9.1.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export form configurations, that may include sensitive data, such as  email addresses, PayPal API credentials, and third-party integration keys by enumerating the nex_forms_Id parameter.
