  name: >
    My Album Gallery <= 1.0.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'style_css' Shortcode Attribute
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The My Album Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'style_css' shortcode attribute in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
