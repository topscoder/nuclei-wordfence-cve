    Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce <= 4.5.5 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Refund Request Cancellation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.5 via the 'wps_rma_cancel_return_request' AJAX endpoint due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete other users refund requests.
