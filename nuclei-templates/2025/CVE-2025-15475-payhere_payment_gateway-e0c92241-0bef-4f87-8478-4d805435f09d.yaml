  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The PayHere Payment Gateway Plugin for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to an improper validation logic in the check_payhere_response function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the status of pending WooCommerce orders to paid/completed/on hold.
