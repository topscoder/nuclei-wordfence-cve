    WP Recipe Maker <= 10.2.2 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 10.2.2 via the api_get_post_summary function due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be retrieved. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from posts they may not be able to edit or read otherwise. This also affects password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
