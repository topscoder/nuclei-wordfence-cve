  name: >
    WP Enable WebP <= 1.0 - Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Enable WebP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to improper file type validation in the 'wpse_file_and_ext_webp' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
