  name: >
    Photo Gallery by Ays <= 6.4.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Bulk Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by Ays plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to missing nonce verification on the bulk action functionality in the 'process_bulk_action()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk operations (delete, publish, or unpublish galleries) via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
