    WP Social Ninja – Embed Social Feeds, Customer Reviews, Chat Widgets (Google Reviews, YouTube Feed, Photo Feeds, and More) <= 3.20.3 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via External Content Import
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Social Ninja – Embed Social Feeds, Customer Reviews, Chat Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 3.20.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on externally-sourced content. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, granted they can post malicious content to a connected Google Business Profile or Facebook page.
