  name: >
    Multiple Plugins and Themes <= (Various Versions) - Authenticated (Contributor+) DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via lightGallery JavaScript Library
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's bundled lightGallery library (<= 2.8.3) in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
