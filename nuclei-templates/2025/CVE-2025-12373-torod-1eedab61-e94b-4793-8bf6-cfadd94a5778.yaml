    Torod – The smart shipping and delivery portal for e-shops and retailers <= 1.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery To Plugin's Settings Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Torod – The smart shipping and delivery portal for e-shops and retailers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
