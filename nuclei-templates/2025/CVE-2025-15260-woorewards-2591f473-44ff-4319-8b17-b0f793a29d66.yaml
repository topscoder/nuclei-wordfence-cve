info:
  name: >
    MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce <= 5.6.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Loyalty Rule Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'ajax' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to modify, add, or delete loyalty program earning rules, including manipulating point multipliers to arbitrary values.
