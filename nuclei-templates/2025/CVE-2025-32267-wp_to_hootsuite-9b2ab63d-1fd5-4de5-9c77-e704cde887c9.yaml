    Post to Social Media – WordPress to Hootsuite <= 1.5.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post to Social Media – WordPress to Hootsuite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the run_log_table_bulk_actions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
