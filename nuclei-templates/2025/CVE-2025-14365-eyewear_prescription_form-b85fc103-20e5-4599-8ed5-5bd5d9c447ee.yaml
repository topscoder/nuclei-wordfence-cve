  name: >
    Eyewear prescription form <= 6.0.1 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary WooCommerce Category Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Eyewear prescription form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.1. This is due to missing capability checks on the RemoveItems AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary WooCommerce product categories, including all of their child categories, via the 'catIds' parameter.
