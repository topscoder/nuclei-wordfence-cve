info:
  name: >
    Restore Permanently delete Post or Page Data <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Restore Permanently delete Post or Page Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rp_dpo_dpa_ajax_dp_delete_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
