    Hospital Management System <= 47.0(20-11-2023) - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Hospital Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 47.0(20-11-2023). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
