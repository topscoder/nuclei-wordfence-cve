info:
  name: >
    Eyewear prescription form <= 6.0.1 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary WooCommerce Product Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Eyewear prescription form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.1. This is due to missing authorization checks on the SubmitCatProductRequest AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary WooCommerce products with custom names, prices, and category assignments via the 'Name', 'Price', and 'Parent' parameters.
