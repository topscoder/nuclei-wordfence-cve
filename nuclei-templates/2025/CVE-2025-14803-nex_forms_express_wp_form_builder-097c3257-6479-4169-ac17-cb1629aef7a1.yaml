  name: >
    Nex-Forms Express WP Form Builder <= 9.1.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Nex-Forms Express WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 9.1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled, or in instances where lower-level users have been granted access to the form builder.
