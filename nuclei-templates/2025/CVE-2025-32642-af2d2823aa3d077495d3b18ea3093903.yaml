    Vite Coupon <= 1.0.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Vite Coupon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
