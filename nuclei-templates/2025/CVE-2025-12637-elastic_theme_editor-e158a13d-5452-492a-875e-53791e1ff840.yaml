info:
  name: >
    Elastic Theme Editor <= 0.0.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Elastic Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a dynamic code generation feature in the process_theme function in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
