    A1POST.BG Shipping for WooCommerce <= 1.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The A1POST.BG Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to an administrator via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
