  name: >
    Checkout Files Upload for WooCommerce <= 2.2.1 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Checkout Files Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in image files that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
