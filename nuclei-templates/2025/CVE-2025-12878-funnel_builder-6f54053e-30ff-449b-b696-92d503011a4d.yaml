    FunnelKit – Funnel Builder for WooCommerce Checkout <= 3.13.1.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via wfop_phone Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The FunnelKit – Funnel Builder for WooCommerce Checkout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `wfop_phone` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.1.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user-supplied `default` attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
