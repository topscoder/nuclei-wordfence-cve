  name: >
    Strong Testimonials <= 3.2.18 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Rating Meta Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Strong Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check in the 'edit_rating' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above to modify or delete the rating meta on any testimonial post, including those created by other users, by reusing a valid nonce obtained from their own testimonial edit screen.
