    Sell BTC - Cryptocurrency Selling Calculator <= 1.5 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'orderform_data' AJAX Action
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Sell BTC - Cryptocurrency Selling Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'orderform_data' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in order records that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the Orders page in the admin dashboard. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.5.
