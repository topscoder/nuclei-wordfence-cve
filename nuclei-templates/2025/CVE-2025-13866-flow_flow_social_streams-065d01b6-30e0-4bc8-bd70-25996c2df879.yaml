    Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream 3.0.0 - 4.7.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via flow_flow_social_auth AJAX action
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the flow_flow_social_auth AJAX action in versions 3.0.0 to 4.7.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify plugin settings and store arbitrary JavaScript that executes whenever the plugin settings page is viewed.
