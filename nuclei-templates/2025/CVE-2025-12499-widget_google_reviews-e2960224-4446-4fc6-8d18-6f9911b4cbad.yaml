    Rich Shortcodes for Google Reviews <= 6.8 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Google Review
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Rich Shortcodes for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the contents of a Google Review in all versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially patched in version 6.6.2.
