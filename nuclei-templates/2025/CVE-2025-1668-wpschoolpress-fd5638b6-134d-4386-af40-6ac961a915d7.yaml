  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The School Management System – WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary user deletion due to a missing capability check on the wpsp_DeleteUser() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to delete arbitrary user accounts.
