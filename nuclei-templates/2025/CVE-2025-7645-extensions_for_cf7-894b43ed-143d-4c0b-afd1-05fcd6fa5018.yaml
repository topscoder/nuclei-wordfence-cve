    Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection) <= 3.2.8 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion Triggered via Admin Form Submission Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete-file' field in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, when an administrator deletes the submission, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
