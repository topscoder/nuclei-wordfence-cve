  name: >
    MediaCommander – Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages <= 2.3.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) Media Folder Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MediaCommander – Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data deletion due to a missing capability check on the import-csv REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to the endpoint using `upload_files` capability check (Author level) for a destructive operation that can delete all folders. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete all folder organization data created by Administrators and other users.
