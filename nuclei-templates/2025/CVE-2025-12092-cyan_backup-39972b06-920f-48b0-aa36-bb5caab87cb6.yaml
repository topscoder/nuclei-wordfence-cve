  name: >
    CYAN Backup <= 2.5.4 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The CYAN Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete' functionality in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
