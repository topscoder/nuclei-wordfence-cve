    teachPress <= 9.0.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Import Delete
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The teachPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the import.php page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete imports via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
