    Wishlist and Save for later for Woocommerce <= 1.1.22 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Wishlist Item Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Wishlist and Save for later for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.22 via the 'awwlm_remove_added_wishlist_page' AJAX action due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete wishlist items from other user's wishlists.
