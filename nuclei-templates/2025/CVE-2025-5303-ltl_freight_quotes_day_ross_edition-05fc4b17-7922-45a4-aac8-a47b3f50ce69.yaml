  name: >
    LTL Freight Quotes – Freightview Edition <= 1.0.11, LTL Freight Quotes – Daylight Edition <=2.2.6 and LTL Freight Quotes – Day & Ross Edition <= 2.1.10 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `expiry_date` Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The LTL Freight Quotes – Freightview Edition, LTL Freight Quotes – Daylight Edition and LTL Freight Quotes – Day & Ross Edition plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the expiry_date parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.11, 2.2.6 and 2.1.10 respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
