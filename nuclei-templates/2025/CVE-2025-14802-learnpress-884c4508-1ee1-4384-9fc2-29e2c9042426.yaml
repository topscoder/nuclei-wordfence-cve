    LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin <= 4.3.2.2 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Instructor+) Teacher Material Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file deletion in versions up to, and including, 4.3.2.2 via the /wp-json/lp/v1/material/{file_id} REST API endpoint. This is due to a parameter mismatch between the DELETE operation and authorization check, where the endpoint uses file_id from the URL path but the permission callback validates item_id from the request body. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access, to delete arbitrary lesson material files uploaded by other teachers via sending a DELETE request with their own item_id (to pass authorization) while targeting another teacher's file_id.
