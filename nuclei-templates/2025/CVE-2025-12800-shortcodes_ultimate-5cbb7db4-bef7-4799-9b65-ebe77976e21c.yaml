    WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate <= 7.4.5 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.4.5 via the su_shortcode_csv_table function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. If the 'Unsafe features' option is explicitly enabled by an administrator, this issue becomes exploitable by Contributor+ attackers
