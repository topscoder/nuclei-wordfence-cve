  name: >
    Featured Image via URL <= 0.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary FIle Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Featured Image via URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation function in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
