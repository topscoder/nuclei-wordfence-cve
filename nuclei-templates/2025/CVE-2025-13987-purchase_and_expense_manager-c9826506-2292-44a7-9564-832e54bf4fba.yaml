  name: >
    Purchase and Expense Manager <= 1.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Purchase Record Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Purchase and Expense Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'sup_pt_handle_deletion' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary purchase records via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
