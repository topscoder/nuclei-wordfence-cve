    Bread & Butter: Gate content + Capture leads + Collect first-party data + Nurture with Ai agents <= 7.10.1321 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Bread & Butter: Gate content + Capture leads + Collect first-party data + Nurture with Ai agents plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.10.1321. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the uploadImage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files that make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
