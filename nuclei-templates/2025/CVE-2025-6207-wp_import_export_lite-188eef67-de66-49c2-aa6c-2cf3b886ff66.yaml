  name: >
    WP Import Export Lite <= 3.9.28 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'wpie_tempalte_import' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.28. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
