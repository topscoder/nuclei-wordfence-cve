  name: >
    Assistant for NextGEN Gallery <= 1.0.9 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Directory Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Assistant for NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary directory deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the /wp-json/nextgenassistant/v1.0.0/control REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary directories on the server, which can cause a complete loss of availability.
