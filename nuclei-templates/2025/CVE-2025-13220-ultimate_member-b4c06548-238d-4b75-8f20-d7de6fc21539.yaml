  name: >
    Ultimate Member <= 2.11.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode Attributes
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode attributes in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
