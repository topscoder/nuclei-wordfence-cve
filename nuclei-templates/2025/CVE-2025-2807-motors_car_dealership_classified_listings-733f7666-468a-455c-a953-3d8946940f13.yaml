  name: >
    Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin <= 1.4.64 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary plugin installations due to a missing capability check in the mvl_setup_wizard_install_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.64. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install and activate arbitrary plugins on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
