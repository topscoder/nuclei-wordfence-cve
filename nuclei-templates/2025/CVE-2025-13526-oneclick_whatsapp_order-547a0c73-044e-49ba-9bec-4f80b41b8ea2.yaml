    OneClick Chat to Order <= 1.0.8 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the 'wa_order_thank_you_override' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive customer information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing/shipping addresses, order contents, and payment methods by simply changing the order ID in the URL.
