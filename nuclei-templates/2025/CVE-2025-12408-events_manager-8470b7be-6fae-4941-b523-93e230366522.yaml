  name: >
    Events Manager <= 7.2.2.2 - Unauthenticated Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.2.2 via the 'get_location' action due to insufficient restrictions on which locations can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private, or draft event locations that they should not have access to.
