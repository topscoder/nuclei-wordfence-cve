  name: >
    Addison < 1.4.8 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Addison theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to 1.4.8 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
