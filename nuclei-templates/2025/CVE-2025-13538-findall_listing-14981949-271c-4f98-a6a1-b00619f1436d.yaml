    FindAll Listing <= 1.0.5 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The FindAll Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the 'findall_listing_user_registration_additional_params' function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited if the FindAll Membership plugin is also activated, because user registration is in that plugin.
