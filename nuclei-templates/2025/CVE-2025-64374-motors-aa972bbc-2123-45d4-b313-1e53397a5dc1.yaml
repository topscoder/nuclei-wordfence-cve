    Motors <= 5.6.82 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Motors - Car Dealer, Rental & Listing WordPress theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the 'mvl_theme_install_base' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.82. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary plugins from arbitrary locations which makes remote code execution possible.
