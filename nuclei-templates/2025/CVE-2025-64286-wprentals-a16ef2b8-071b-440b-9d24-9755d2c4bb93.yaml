    Rentals <= 3.13.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Rentals theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.13.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
