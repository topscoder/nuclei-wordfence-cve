    Buzz Club – Night Club, DJ and Music Festival Event WordPress Theme <= 2.0.4 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited Arbitrary Option Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Buzz Club – Night Club, DJ and Music Festival Event WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the 'cmsmasters_hide_admin_notice' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to 'hide' on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.
