    SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity <= 1.12.20 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Survey Renaming
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.20. This is due to missing nonce verification on the 'SurveyJS_RenameSurvey' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to rename surveys via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
