    School Management System – WPSchoolPress <= 2.2.16 - Missing Authorization to Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The School Management System – WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the wpsp_UpdateTeacher() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to update arbitrary user details including email which makes it possible to request a password reset and access arbitrary user accounts, including administrators.
