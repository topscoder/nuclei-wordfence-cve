    Sala - Startup & SaaS WordPress Theme <= 1.1.4 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Password Reset/Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Sala - Startup & SaaS WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
