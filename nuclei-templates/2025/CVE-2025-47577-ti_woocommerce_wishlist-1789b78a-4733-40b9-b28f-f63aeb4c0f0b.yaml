    TI WooCommerce Wishlist <= 2.9.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the tinvwl_upload_file_wc_fields_factory() function which has 'test_type' for 'wp_handle_upload' set to false in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when the WC Fields Factory plugin is also installed and enabled.
