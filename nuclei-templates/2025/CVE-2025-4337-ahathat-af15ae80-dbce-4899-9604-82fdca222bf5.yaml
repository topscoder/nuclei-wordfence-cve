    AHAthat Plugin <= 1.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to AHA Page Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The AHAthat Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the aha_plugin_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete AHA pages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
