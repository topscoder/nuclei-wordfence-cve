  name: >
    Buddypress Humanity <= 1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Buddypress Humanity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate the privileges of an arbitrary user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
