    wModes – Catalog Mode, Product Pricing, Enquiry Forms & Promotions | for WooCommerce <= 1.2.2 - Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The wModes – Catalog Mode, Product Pricing, Enquiry Forms & Promotions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to access sensitive information via the AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive information including user emails, usernames, roles, capabilities, and WooCommerce data such as products and payment methods.
