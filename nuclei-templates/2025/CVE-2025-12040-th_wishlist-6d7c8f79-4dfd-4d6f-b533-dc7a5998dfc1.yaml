    Wishlist for WooCommerce <= 1.0.9 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Unauthenticated Wishlist Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wishlist for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9 via several functions in class-th-wishlist-frontend.php due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify other user's wishlists
