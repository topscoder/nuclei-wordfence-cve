    Password Policy Manager <= 2.0.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Password Policy Manager | Password Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password through the moppm_submit_new_pass() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
