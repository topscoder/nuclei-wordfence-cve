info:
  name: >
    Fancy Product Designer | WooCommerce WordPress <= 6.4.8 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure via 'pdf' Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to improper error handling in the PDF upload functionality that exposes server filesystem paths and stack traces in error messages. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
