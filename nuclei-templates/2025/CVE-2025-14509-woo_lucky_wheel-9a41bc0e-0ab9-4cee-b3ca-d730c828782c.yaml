    Lucky Wheel for WooCommerce – Spin a Sale <= 1.1.13 - Authenticated (Administrator+) PHP Code Injection via Conditional Tags
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Lucky Wheel for WooCommerce – Spin a Sale plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.13. This is due to the plugin using eval() to execute user-supplied input from the 'Conditional Tags' setting without proper validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. In WordPress multisite installations, this allows Site Administrators to execute arbitrary code, a capability they should not have since plugin/theme file editing is disabled for non-Super Admins in multisite environments.
