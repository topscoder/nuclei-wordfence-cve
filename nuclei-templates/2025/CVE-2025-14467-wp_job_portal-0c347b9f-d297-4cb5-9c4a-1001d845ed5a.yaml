info:
  name: >
    WP Job Portal <= 2.3.9 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Job Description Field
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Job Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9. This is due to the plugin explicitly whitelisting the `<script>` tag in its `WPJOBPORTAL_ALLOWED_TAGS` configuration and using insufficient input sanitization when saving job descriptions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts into job description fields via the job creation/editing interface. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and other malicious activities.This only impacts multi-site installations, or those with unfiltered_html disabled.
