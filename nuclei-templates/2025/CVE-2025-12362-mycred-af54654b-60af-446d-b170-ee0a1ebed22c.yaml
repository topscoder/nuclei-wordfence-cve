    myCred – Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks, Badges, and Loyalty Program <= 2.9.7 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Withdrawal Request Approval
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The myCred – Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks, Badges, and Loyalty Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 2.9.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve withdrawal requests, modify user point balances, and manipulate the payment processing system via the cashcred_pay_now AJAX action.
