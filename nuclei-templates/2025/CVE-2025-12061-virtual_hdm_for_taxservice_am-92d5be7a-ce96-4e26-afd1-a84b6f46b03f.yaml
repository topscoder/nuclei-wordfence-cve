  name: >
    Tax Service Electronic HDM <= 1.2.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The TAX SERVICE Electronic HDM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'importTaxService' AJAX endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query and a missing capability check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database and inject new users to completely takeover the site.
