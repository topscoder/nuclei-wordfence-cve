    Modal Window <= 6.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Ipdate
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Modal Window plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
