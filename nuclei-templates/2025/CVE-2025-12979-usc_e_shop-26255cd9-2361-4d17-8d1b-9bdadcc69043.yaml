    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.11.24 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'usces_export' action in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.24. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access configured payment credentials (ex. PayPal api secret) , as well as business contact details, mail templates, and other operational settings tied to the store.
