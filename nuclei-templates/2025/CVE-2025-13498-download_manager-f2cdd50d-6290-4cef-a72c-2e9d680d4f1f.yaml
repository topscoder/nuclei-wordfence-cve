  name: >
    Download Manager <= 3.3.32 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Media Attachment Password Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of sensitive information in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.32. This is due to missing authorization and capability checks on the `wpdm_media_access` AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve passwords and access control settings for protected media attachments, which can then be used to bypass the intended media protection and download restricted files.
