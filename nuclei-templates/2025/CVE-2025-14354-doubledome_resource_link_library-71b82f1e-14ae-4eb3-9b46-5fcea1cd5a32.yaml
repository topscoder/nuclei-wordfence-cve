  name: >
    Resource Library for Logged In Users <= 1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Multiple Administrative Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Resource Library for Logged In Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple administrative functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform various unauthorized actions including creating, editing, and deleting resources and categories via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
