  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GamiPress – Gamification plugin to reward points, achievements, badges & ranks in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the gamipress_ajax_get_posts and gamipress_ajax_get_users functions in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to enumerate users, including their email addresses and to retrieve titles of private posts.
