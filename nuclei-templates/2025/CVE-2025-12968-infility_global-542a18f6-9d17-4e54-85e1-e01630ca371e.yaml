  name: >
    Infility Global <= 2.14.23 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability checks in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.23. This is due to the `upload_file` function in the `infility_import_file` class only validating the MIME type which can be easily spoofed, and the `import_data` function missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
