  name: >
    Multi Uploader for Gravity Forms <= 1.1.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Multi Uploader for Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'plupload_ajax_delete_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server.
