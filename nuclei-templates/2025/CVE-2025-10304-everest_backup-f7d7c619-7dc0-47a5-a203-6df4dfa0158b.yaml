    Everest Backup – WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin <= 2.3.8 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Backup Failure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Everest Backup – WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the process_status_unlink() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the back-up progress files and cause a back-up to fail while it is in progress.
