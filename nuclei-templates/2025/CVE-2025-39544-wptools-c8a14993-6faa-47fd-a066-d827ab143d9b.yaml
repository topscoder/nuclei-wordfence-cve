    WP Tools <= 5.18 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Renaming
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the deactivate_mu_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files (which is the equivalent of arbitrary file deletion) via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
