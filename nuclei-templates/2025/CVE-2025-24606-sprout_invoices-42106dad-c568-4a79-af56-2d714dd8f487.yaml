    Client Invoicing by Sprout Invoices – Easy Estimates and Invoices <= 20.8.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Client Invoicing by Sprout Invoices – Easy Estimates and Invoices for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the maybe_change_status() function in all versions up to, and including, 20.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change invoice statuses.
