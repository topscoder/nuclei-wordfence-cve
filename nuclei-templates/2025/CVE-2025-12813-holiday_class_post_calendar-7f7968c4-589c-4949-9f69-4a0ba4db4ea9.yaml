info:
  name: >
    Holiday class post calendar <= 7.1 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via 'contents'
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Holiday class post calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 7.1 via the 'contents' parameter. This is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied data when creating a cache file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.
