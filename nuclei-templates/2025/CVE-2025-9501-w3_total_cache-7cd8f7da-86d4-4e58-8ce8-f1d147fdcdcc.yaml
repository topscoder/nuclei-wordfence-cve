  name: >
    W3 Total Cache <= 2.8.12 - Unauthenticated Command Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.12 via _parse_dynamic_mfunc . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server when comments are enabled and a post has been incorrectly injected with the mfunc tags. Please note we consider this to be a theoretical issue, and as such we rejected the original report from the researcher who then submitted this to WPScan. WPScan assigned a CVE ID, but we do not agree that this is a true security vulnerability. Exploitation of this issue is theoretical and requires gaining access to a secret value much like gaining access to a password.
