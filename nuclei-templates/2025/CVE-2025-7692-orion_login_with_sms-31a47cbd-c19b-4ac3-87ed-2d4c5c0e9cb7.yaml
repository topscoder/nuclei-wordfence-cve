  name: >
    Orion Login with SMS <= 1.0.5 - Authenticated Bypass via Weak OTP
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Orion Login with SMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the olws_handle_verify_phone() function not utilizing a strong enough OTP value, exposing the hash needed to generate the OTP value, and no restrictions on the number of attempts to submit the code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, if they have access to their phone number.
