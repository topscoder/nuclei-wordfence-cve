  name: >
    Fancy Product Designer <= 6.4.8 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the data-to-image.php and pdf-to-image.php files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
